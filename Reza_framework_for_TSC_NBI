# Transport Slice Controller Northboun Interfaces (NBI)

As shown in Figure 1, the Transport Slice Controller NBI interfaces
provides the abstaction of the transport slices to the higher level
system.  It simplifies the automation, assurance and optimization of
transport slices by hiding all the complexity of the transport slice
for realization and monitoring.  The main characteristics of these
new interfaces are:

* These interfaces allow a request and response about resources.
  It should not allow negotiation, as this would be complex and not
  have a clear benefit

* The provider of these interfaces is the higher layer sytem which
  needs to create an E2E network slice.  The provider of this
  interface is the lower layer netowork controllers which provide
  the realization of the connectivities (i.e. transport slice).

* These interfaces are needed in industry to achieve true standard
  based automation of E2E network slices.  It provides technology-
  agnostic intent-based interfaces to the higher level system (note
  that as an example, these interfaces are similar to interfaces
  defined by 3GPP for 5G RAN and 5G Core slices)

* These interfaces are independent of type of network functions or
  services which needs to be connected, i.e. it is independent of
  any specific repository, software usage, protocol, or platform
  which realizes the physical or virtual network functions.

* These interfaces standardizes a way to learn about what resources
  are available in the network which impact the creation of the
  transport slices

* These technology independent interfaces simplify the
  creation/modification/deletion of the transports slices by
  describing it in a standard way along with all the endpoints that
  compose a transport slice, their properties, attributes and their
  SLO requirements

* These interfaces provide capabilities for transport slice
  monitoring and analytics which means that these interface allow
  enabling/disabling the collection of the transport slices
  telemetry, assurance and Threshold Crossing Alert (TCA) data and
  providing them to the higher level system

* These interfaces provide capabilities for optimization of the
  transport slices.  Since the E2E network slices are dynamic in
  nature, it is important to make sure the transport slice SLOs are
  valid and in case any SLO violation, the transport slice
  controller performs the closed-loop action and inform the higher
  layer system for the violation and closed-loop action.  These
  interfaces allow this fucntionality.
 
* These interfaces allows binding and association between
  "Transport slices" to "Other Slices"

* These interfaces complements various IETF services, tunnels, path
  models by providing an abstract layer on top of these models

      Figure 3: Transport Slice Controller NBI high-level data model

Refering to Figure 3, the proposed TSC NBI data model should include
the following building blocks:

* transport-slice-info: It contains information  related to transport 
slice such as transport slice name, transport slice ID etc.

* e2e-network-slice-info: A list of all E2E network slices mapped to
  a transport slice.  Note that transport slice to E2E network slice
  is a one-to-many mapping, i.e. one transport slice can be used
  inside more that one e2e network slice

* transport-slice-group: A transport slice is a set of transport-
  slice-groups where each of them contains a set of distint
  connections.  Each transport-slice-group contains:

      * list of endpoints: A transport slice comprises a set of 
        connection among various endpoints.  These attributes 
        specify the endpoint in a generic fashion. The possible 
        attributes of the endpoint could be IP address, node name, 
        domain ID and termination points etc. The details will be 
        provided in TSC NBI YANG draft.

      * list of connection-links: These are the list of connections 
        between endpoints. 

      * list of transport-slice-policies: The request from TSC NBI 
        to create the transport slices will have optional and mandatory 
        policies, which specify the desired "transport slice SLO" along with
        information on monitorig and mapping functions. This draft 
        proposes three types of transport slice policies to be supported. 
        The details of these policies shall be provided in TSC NBI YANG draft:

             * transport-slice-slo-policy: This is a mandatory policy, which
               represents in a generic and technology-agnostics way the required 
               "transport slice SLO" needed to realize a transport slice.  
               It is defined per transport-slice-group and contains the 
               bounded latency, bandwidth, reliability, security etc.

             * transport-slice-selection-policy: This is an optional policy.  
               In some deployment, the higher level system might want to influence
               the transport slice controller (TSC) on how to realize a transport 
               slice by providing some information regarding the type of technologies 
               and tunnels. 

             * transport-slice-assurance-policy: This is an optional policy.  
               The higher level system might want to influence the transport slice 
               controller for transport slice assurance on how to perform 
               monitoring, analytics and optimization.  This policy will be used
               and contains, the type of assurance needed, time interval, 
               how often inform the higher level system etc.
