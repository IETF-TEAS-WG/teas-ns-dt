                   IETF Definition of Transport Slice
             draft-nsdt-teas-transport-slice-definition-03

Abstract

   This document describes the definition of a slice in the transport
   networks and its characteristics.  The purpose here is to bring
   clarity and a common understanding of the transport slice concept and
   describe related terms and their meaning.  It explains how transport
   slices can be used in end to end network slices, or independently.

1.  Introduction

   A number of use cases benefit from establishing network connectivity
   providing transport and assurance of a specific set of network
   resources.  In this document, as detailed in subsequent sections, we
   refer to this connectivity and resource commitment as transport
   slices.  Services that might benefit from the transport slices
   include:

   o  5G services (e.g. eMBB, URLLC, mMTC)(See [TS.23.501-3GPP])

   o  Network wholesale services

   o  Network infrastructure sharing among operators

   o  NFV connectivity and Data Center Interconnec

   This document defines the concept of transport slices that provide
   connectivity with specific commitment of network resources between a
   number of end points over a shared network infrastructure.

   Transport slices are created and managed within the scope of one or
   more underlying network technologies (e.g.  IP, MPLS, optical).
   These transport slices are expected to enable a diverse set of
   applications, that have different requirements on communication, to
   coexist on the same network infrastructure.

   Transport slices relate to a more general topic of network slicing.
   It is not the goal of this document to define this broader concept,
   but in general, it is a methodology to describe the logical (or
   abstract) partitioning of network resources associated with a service
   or an application.

1.1.  Rationale

   Transport slice is described as a construct that specifies
   connectivity requirements with an emphasis on assurance of those
   requirements.  Transport slices are unaware of any underlying
   infrastructure connectivity (hence, the term "transport").  The types
   of underlying provider networks can be based on any combination of
   IP, Ethernet, MPLS and Optical technologies.

   Existing VPN (L2 or L3) network and particularly service models come
   close to satisfying similar requirements.  The difference is that a
   user of transport slice does not concern with the specific details
   related to the connectivity, such as what are the provider addresses,
   VRFs, or what routing protocols to use, and so on.  In cases where
   customers need more control over network technology aspects, direct
   use of VPN technologies or service models will be more suitable.

   Transport slices also include specification of resources related to
   network functions that are necessary for several customer
   applications.  Thus, the goal of transport slice is to serve as a
   generic SLO-assured connectivity construct over different kinds of
   underlying infrastructures.

3.  Definition and Scope of Transport Slice

   The definition of a transport slice is as follows:

   "A transport slice is a logical network topology connecting a number
   of endpoints and a set of shared or dedicated network resources,
   which are used to satisfy specific Service Level Objectives (SLO)".

   The text below describes transport slices in more detail.

   A transport slice consists of a set of connections between multiple
   endpoints with a specified connectivity type and one or more SLOs
   associated with it.  SLOs are used to describe different
   characteristics of network resources associated with the service
   delivered and corresponding parameters necessary to realize the
   transport slice.

   Transport slice specification should be technology-agnostic, and the
   means for transport slice realization can be chosen depending on
   several factors such as service requirements, specifications or
   capabilities of underlying infrastructure.  The structure and
   different characteristics of transport slices are described in the
   following sections.

   The term "transport" in transport slice is derived from the
   definition of Transport Network in the section 1.3.1 of [RFC5921] : A
   Transport Network provides transparent transmission of user traffic



Rokui, et al.           Expires December 6, 2020                [Page 4]

   between attached client devices by establishing and maintaining
   point-to-point or point-to-multipoint connections between such
   devices.  "Slice" refers to the characteristics that separate one
   type of user-traffic from other types of traffic.  Thus, transport
   slice assumes that an underlying transport network has capability to
   change the configurations of the network nodes on demand, through in-
   band signalling or via controller(s) and to provide transport
   transmissions with fulfilling all or some of SLOs to specific flows.

4.  Transport Slice System Characteristics

   The following subsections describe the characteristics needed for
   support of transport slices.

4.1.  Service Level Objectives for Transport Slices

   A transport slice is defined in terms of several quantifiable
   characteristics or service-level objectives (SLOs).  These objectives
   define a set of network resource parameters or values necessary to
   provide a service as requested for a given transport slice.  SLOs
   will not describe 'how' will trasnport slices will be implemented or
   realized in the underlying networks.  They will instead be defined in
   terms of dimensions of operations (time, capacity,...), availability
   and other attributes.  A transport slice can have one or more SLOs
   associated with it.  The SLO values can be defined in each direction
   and for specific subsets of two or more endpoints (i.e. for a subset
   of connections in transport slice).

   The values of requested SLOs should be clearly specified.  It should
   be possible to monitor and measure the performance of transport
   slices against the requested SLOs and verify that they are being met.
   Some SLOs can be measured directly through collection of metrics or
   statistics from the network,while others are deduced from measurable
   objectives and may require additional tools or mechanisms to measure
   their target values.  Accordingly, SLOs can be categorized in to
   'Directly Measurable Objectives' or 'Indirectly Measurable
   Objectives' as follows:

   Some of the 'Directly Measurable Objectives' are: Objectives':

   o  Guaranteed Bandwidth

   o  Guaranteed Maximum Latency

   o  Maximum permissible delay variation

   o  Availability




Rokui, et al.           Expires December 6, 2020                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    draft-nsdt-transport-slice-definition        June 2020


   o  Maximum permissible packet loss rate

   o  NF resources

   o  Other objectives could be specified

   Some of the 'Indirectly Measurable Objectives' are:

   o  Shared fate resources

   o  Security

   o  others objectives such as geographical restrictions, maximum
      occupancy level, etc. could be specified

   The definiton of the these objectives are as follows:

   o  Guaranteed minimum Bandwidth: Minimum requested bandwidth between
      two endpoints.  The bandwidth is measured in data rate units of
      bits per second and can be requested unidirectionally.

   o  Guaranteed maximum Latency: Maximum permissible network delay when
      transmitting between two endpoints.  The latency is measured in
      terms of network characteristics (excluding application-level
      latency).  [RFC2681] and [RFC7679] discuss round trip times and
      one-way metrics, respectively.

   o  Maximum permissible delay variation: Packet delay variation (PDV)
      as defined by [RFC3393], is measured by the difference in the one-
      way delay between sequential packets in a flow.  Minimizing
      variations in the delay are important for real-time applications.

   o  Maximum permissible packet loss rate: is defined by the ratio of
      packets dropped to packets transmitted between two endpoints.  See
      [RFC7680]

   o  NF resources: These resources may be optionally used in order to
      provide specification for virtual network functions which are part
      of the transport slice endpoints.  See [NFVGST].

   o  Availability: is defined as the ratio of uptime to
      total_time(uptime+downtime).

   o  Security: This objective may request for encryption [RFC4303]
      between two end-points explicitly to meet architecture
      recommendations as in [TS33.210] or for compliance [HIPAA][PCI].
      Other security requests can be made as specified in [I2NSF]

      *  Note: Security violations are difficult to observe and cannot
         be measured as quantifiable metric.  Still, the user of
         transport slice should be able to request certain criteria for
         compliance and be able to identify exceptions and unexpected
         traffic.  For this purpose [i2nsf-nsf-monitoring-data-model-06]
         can be leveraged.

   Additional objectives may be necessary, such as specifying specific
   characteristics/ well defined paths or domains that a slice may
   transit.  A transport slice carries multiple flows between the 2
   endpoints, therefore objectives should also say if they are
   aggregates or on per flow basis and in such case to be specific
   enough for the system to be able to identify these specifics (subset
   of flows).

   Optionally, other traffic characteristics may be requested.  These
   include for example MTU, traffic type (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet,
   unstructured.  A transport slice carries multiple flows between the 2
   endpoints, therefore objectives should also say if they are for the
   entire connection, group of flows or on per flow basis.  Flow
   characteristics of a transport slice should specify the scale of the
   flows (i.e. maximum number of accommodatable flows) and optionally a
   maximum number of countable rosurce units, e.g IP or MAC addresses a
   slice might consume.

   Further description of a set of measurable attributes is captured in
   [I-D.contreras-teas-slice-nbi].  [Reza's comment: which section of
   this draft??)

4.2.  Endpoint Variation

   Transport slice endpoints are the terminating or originating nodes
   requiring connectivity with a set of specific SLOs.  Endpoints may be
   termination points on devices or functions.

4.2.1.  Types of Endpoints

   There are two types of endpoints based on the functions they perform.

   Transport type endpoint:  These endpoints function as the source and
      destination of connections in transport slice where they perform
      the forwarding of the user payload.

   Service type endpoint:  These endpoints are related to the transport
      slice realizaton where they manipulate, processe or modifie the
      user data payload (based on policies).  In some scenarios the
      service endpoints are identical to transport slice endpoints.  A
      non-exhaustive list of devices which contains service endpoints

      are routers, switches, roufirewalls, WAN and application
      acceleration, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), server load balancers,
      NAT44 [RFC3022], NAT64 [RFC6146], HTTP header enrichment
      functions, and TCP optimizers.  The generic term "L4-L7 services"
      is often used to describe such service functions (SFs).

   The term Network Function (NF) covers both service and transport
   types of endpoints as defined in [I-D.ietf-teas-sf-aware-topo-model].

4.2.2.  Connectivity patterns within Transport Slice

   The transport slices are a set of connection among a seto of
   endpoints.  These connections can be point to point (P2P), point to
   multipoint (P2MP), multi-point to point (MP2P), or multi-point to
   multi-point (MP2MP) based on the topology requested by the customer.

4.3.  Vertical Transport Slice (tbd)

   Transport slice may follow a hierarchical relationship that would
   provide a vertical structure to it.  This is used for building multi-
   layer slices in which each layer provides an abstraction, as well as
   an independent monitoring, performance, control and management of the
   resources.  The vertical transport slice characteristic maybe used in
   2 forms:

   o  The Transport slice itself where it represents a hierarchy of
      abstracted transport slices.  In this case, realization will be
      done just once with a particular technology.  Thus, the lowest
      transport slice in the hierarchy that can not be decomposed
      further will be one to one mapping to its instance of realized
      transport slice.

   o  Each layer (physical, datalink, or IP) has its own set of
      resources that can be provided to the upper layer as a transport
      slice.  Thus, transport slice at one layer is used by the layer
      above.  This type of multi-layer vertical transport slice
      associates resources at different layers.  For example, an IP
      transport slice would utilize one or more optical transport slice.
      In this case, realization will be done for a particular technology
      at that particular layer.  Thus, the lowest transport slice in
      this type of hierarchy that can not be decomposed further will be
      an instance of realized physical layer transport slice.

       Figure 1: Transport Slice Vertical and Horizontal Composition

   Figure 1 shows the transport slice hierarchy.  Slices TS11 and TS12
   are composed together to form TS1 that is the top level transport
   slice definition, TS121 and TS122 collectively define TS12.  The SLO
   for bandwidth guarantee will be shared and latency guarantee will be
   split into latency in networks 2 and 3.  To emphasize the
   hierarchical structure, consider Network-2 and Network-3 are in the
   same administrative domain but use different transport technologies
   SR and L2VPN respectively.  Then instead of presenting 2 transport
   slices, Operator-z can expose only one transport slice TS12
   abstracting the underlying transport technology details.

      Note: The specification to connect TS121 and TS122 are similar to
      those connecting TS12 and TS11.

4.4.  Horizontal Composition of Transport slice

   In contrast, horizontal transport slices enable the composition of
   multiple realized transport slices.  Since transport slices are not
   necessarily a single encapsulation tunnel and may traverse through
   different data planes, each realized transport slice will require a
   stitching, interworking or mapping function.  These stitching
   functions can be viewed as a type of intermediate network function
   endpoints.  For instance in Figure 1, TS11 and TS12 are horizontal
   transport slices.  If we assume that TS11 is an L2 tunnel and TS12 is
   an SRV6 based path, then a 'Service type EP' (not shown in the
   figure) is needed for translation.

   Author's notes: This service type EP is a new type of transport slice
   specific service function.  We may call it transport slice gateway.

5.  Transport Slice Structure

   A transport slice is a set of connections among various endpoints to
   form a logical network.  The goal is to achieve specific SLO for a
   customer as shown in Figure 2.  The endpoints may be user equipment,
   any physical or virtual network functions (PNF/VNF), or any network
   service for that matter.  Similarly, the connections may be virtual
   or physical links of any type of technology.

                         Figure 2: Transport slice

   Figure 2 illustrates a case where a transport slice provides
   connectivity between a set of endpoints pairs with specific
   characteristics for SLO (e.g. gauranteed minimum bandwidth of x bps
   and gauranteed delay of less than y ms).  The endpoints may be
   distributed in the underlay networks, and a transport slice can be
   deployed across multiple network domains.  Also, the endpoints on the
   same transport slice may belong to the same address space.

   The "Transport Slices" provides various connections with certain SLO
   between various endpoints whereas the transport slice realization
   addresses its implementation using various technologies.  In short,
   the transport slice involves both its definition and its realization;

   the transport slice definiton addresses the set of connectivities
   with required SLOs whereas the transport slice realization addresses
   how this transport slice is depolyed in the network for certain
   network technologies.

   A transport slice is built based on a request from a higher level
   operation system.  The interface to higher operations systems should
   express the needed connectivity in a technology-agnostic way, and
   slice customers don't need to recognize concrete configurations based
   on the technologies (e.g. being more declarative than imperative).
   The request to instantiate a transport slice is represented with some
   indicators such as SLO, and technologies are selected and managed
   accordingly.

   In the context of network slices, the term sub-slice or slice-subnet
   comes up in other standard organizations, however, w.r.t. the IP/MPLS
   based transport networks these terms are all equivalent.

   Furthermore, the structure of transport slices may be layered
   vertically or composed horizontally, i.e. operationally, a transport
   slice maybe decomposed in two or more transport slices which are then
   independently realized and managed.  This is further described in
   Section 4.3.

5.1.  Stakeholders

   A transport slice and its realization involves the following
   stakeholders and it is relevant to define them for consistent
   terminology.

   Customer or User:  A customer is a user of transport slice.
      Customers may request for monitoring of associated resources or
      specific changes to them.  A user may either directly manage its
      service by interfacing with the transport slice controller or
      indirectly through an orchestrator.

   Orchestrator:  An orchestrator is an entity that aggregates different
      services, resource and network requirements.  It interfaces with
      the transport slice controllers.

   Transport Slice Controller (TSC):  It realizes a transport slice in
      the network, maintains and monitors the run-time state of
      resources and topologies associated with it.  A well-defined
      interface is needed between different types of transport slice
      controller and different types of orchestrator.  A transport slice
      operator (or slice operator for short) manages one or more
      transport slices using the Transport Slice Controller(s).

   Transport Network Controller:  is some form of network infrastructure
      controller that offers network resources to TSC to realize a
      particular transport slice.  These may be existing network
      controllers associated with one or more specific technologies that
      may be adapted to the function of realizing transport slices in a
      network.

5.2.  Transport Slice Controller Interfaces

   The interworking and inter-operability among the different
   stakeholders is required to provide common means of provisioning,
   operating and monitoring the transport slices.  The following
   communication interfaces are identified (see Figure 3).

   TSC Northbound Interface (NBI):  The TSC Northbound Interface is an
      interface between a higher level system, e.g.  'E2E network slice
      orchestrator' and the 'Transport slice controller'.  It is a
      technology agnostic interface.  Over this NBI, slice
      characteristics and other requirements can be informed to TSC and
      current state of a transport slice may be requested.

   TSC Southbound Interface (SBI):  The TSC Southbound Interface is an
      interface between 'Transport slice controller (TSC)' and network
      controller(s).  These interfaces are technology-specific and can
      utilize many of the network models.

5.3.  Transport slice Realization

   Realization of a Transport Slice is a mapping of underlying
   infrastructure with its definition.  It is technology specific entity
   that is created and maintained over southbound interfaces.  The
   Network controller(s) export the connectivity and resource mappings
   to the TSC.  The network controller abstracts the details of
   underlying resources from the TSC.

   The realization may be achieved in the form of either physical or
   logical connectivity through VPNs, a variety of tunneling
   technologies such as segment routing, SFC, etc.  Accordingly,
   endpoints may be realized as physical or logical service or network
   functions.

6.  Relationship with End-to-End Network Slicing

   An end-to-end (E2E) network slice is a complete logical network that
   provides a service in its entirety with a specific assurance to the
   customer.  A transport slice concerns with those assurance aspects
   only within the transport networks.  Consider Figure 4, where a
   network operator has an E2E network slice that traverses multiple

   technology-specific networks.  Each of these networks might use any
   number of technologies, including but not limited to IP, MPLS, Fiber-
   Optics (e.g.  WDM, DWDM), Passive Optical Networking (PON),
   Microwave, etc.

   Each of these networks includes multiple (physical or virtual) nodes
   and may also provide network functions beyond simply carrying of
   technology-specific protocol data units.  The types of nodes used in
   any of these networks may include:

   o  Packet/frame processing nodes (e.g., Routers, Switches)

   o  Application servers

   o  Service Functions(e.g., Firewall, Loadbalancer)

   o  Radio Access Network (RAN) components

   o  Mobile Core components

   o  Microwave transceivers

   o  Optical repeaters

   o  etc.

   Each network may support different technologies and an E2E network
   slice is a combination of these networks.  As an example:

   o  Network 1 might contain multiple 5G RAN nodes connected to a few
      Cell Site Gateways (CSG) routers.

   o  Network 2 might have one or more layer-3 routers and layer-2
      switches which may run on top of an optical network.

   o  Network 3 might have a number of 5G RAN nodes connected to Passive
      Optical Network (PON) switches.

                        Figure 4: E2E network slice

   When an operator-z creates a specific E2E network slice, it may
   create one or more of transport slices and other slices (application
   logic or other system functions).

   An independent E2E logical network (called E2E network slice) is
   created for a service (e.g.  CCTV, autonomous driving, HD map, etc.)
   with a specific network SLO requirement e.g. a secure connection with
   an E2E latency less than 5ms, from End User-x (EU-x) to End User-y
   (EU-y).  EU-x maybe a 5G user equipment such as an infotainment unit
   in a car, CCTV, or a car for autonomous driving, etc. and EU-y in 5G
   is 5G application server, IMS, etc.

   In Figure 4, "E2E NS" is that logical network with requested SLO
   between EU-x to EU-y and is associated with a customer and a specific
   service type.

Appendix A.  Discussions

A.1.  On Meeting guarantees of service objectives (tbd)

   Due to overloading of the term, a further discussion is added to
   highlight two aspects of isolation, first the resolution of isolation
   of an objective (as described above) and second, the dedicated use or
   a hard-separation perspective of the resource.

   Providing a hard resolution of guarantee for the characteristics of a
   transport slice means that the behavior and performance of other
   transport slices should not impact that slice, even if they run over
   the same underlying infrastructure or use logically shared network
   resources.





Rokui, et al.           Expires December 6, 2020               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft    draft-nsdt-transport-slice-definition        June 2020


   In the context of soft resolution of guarantees, since the transport
   slices are logically partitioned over the shared resources, a certain
   degree of commitment to the guarantee is expected even when it is not
   hard.  When the shared resource pools begin to become saturated, SLO
   violations can happen, however, impacting only the performance or
   operation of service associated with the transport slice.

   This degree of isolation can be derived from availability
   characteristics requested, such as whether a hard or soft guarantee
   was requested.  Requesting a hard guarantee may commit more resources
   than would be required for a softer limit.

   In addition, resource isolation may be applied to ensure dedicated
   access to a particular node, for instance.  In such requests a
   dedicated allocation to a link, node and/or other resources to create
   a transport slice for a particular service.  For example, a mission-
   critical service may ask for a dedicated router and/or a link or port
   for complete isolation from other services.

   When realizing a transport slice, a network controller should be
   responsible for allocating and providing resources according to the
   specified objectives.

   SLO violations can occur for two reasons and corresponding statements
   apply

   o  Shared resource interference: i.e. multiple transport slices
      simultaneously share the same resource, and one of them consume
      the resource in surplus.  If the SLO guarantees are strictly
      required, then the network controller can be informed of this by
      requesting a hard guarantee.  Note that the terms hard and soft
      limit are requirement oriented and different from what is
      specified in, [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn]).

   o  Resource failure or fault occurs, such as a link or node failure.
      Where it is important to defend against these, the relevant
      characteristics on resource redundancy (and perhaps some other
      characteristics on restoration speed and other factors) need to be
      specified.

      *  Restoration isolation: the network is not impacted for a period
         longer than the given time.  For example, failover or the
         service restoration takes no longer than some number of
         seconds.  This is specified by Availability SLO.

      *  Protection isolation: the network path is protected with
         specified backup path.  This is specified by Availability SLO.

   SLA vs SLO discussion: In defining transport slices, the term SLO
   instead of SLA is used even though SLAs are more commonly used term
   by the operators.  SLOs are definitive and measurable parameters
   associated with a service, therefore, network resource and
   connectivity requirements are defined accurately.  In contrast,
   service level agreements represent contracts for a service between a
   service provider and a service consumer (or subscriber).  Providers
   then translate SLA into SLO; these translations vary from one service
   provider to the other.  Therefore, all through within the scope of
   transport slices term SLO will be used.

A.2.  level of confidence

   Additionally, transport slices should be able to specify 'level of
   confidence'.  It the ability to satisfy a "guarantee" of an
   objective.  The confidence level (or level of commitment) may be
   expressed separately for each of the above objectives.  For example
   packet loss objective can be no more than 10% loss - 99.9999% of the
   time, while bandwidth can not go below 1% 99.99% of the time.

   Since no guarantee can prevent from hardware failures (such as losing
   a node), additional protection against such issues is possible by
   specifying confidence level characteristics.  The confidence does not
   say anything about the specific implementation of how it is are
   achieved.  Different implementations might use different techniques,
   from avoiding oversubsription to dedicating particular links or their
   virtual fractions to particular transport slices.
