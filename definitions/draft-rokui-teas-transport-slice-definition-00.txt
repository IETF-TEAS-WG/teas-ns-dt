1.  Introduction

   Network slicing is a methodology to generically describe the logical
   partitioning of network resources associated with a service or an
   application.  Network slicing is expected to enable diverse devices/
   applications that have different requirements on communication to
   coexist on the same network efficiently.  Also, a network slice
   sometimes traverses multiple domains, and generalized interfaces,
   operations, and management would be important.

   Some key applications which might benefit from the use of network
   slicing include:

   o  5G services (e.g. eMBB, URLLC, mMTC)(See [TS.23.501-3GPP])

   o  Network wholesale

   o  Network infrastructure sharing among the operators

   o  NFV connectivity (Data Center Interconnect)

   A 'network slice' is composed of different endpoints, application
   logic and specific connectivity between them.  Transport slices are a
   part of the network slices that fulfill connection requirements
   between the endpoints.  Transport slices are created and managed
   within the scope of transport networks (e.g.  IP, MPLS, optical).

   This document provides a definition of a slice in the transport
   network (called "transport slice"), and describes its
   characteristics.

3.  High Level Description of End-to-End Network Slicing

   An end-to-end (E2E) network slice is a complete logical network that
   provides a service in its entirety with a specific assurance to the
   customer.  A transport slice concerns with those assurance aspects
   only within the transport networks.  To illustrate the IETF
   definitions of both E2E network slice and transport slice, consider
   the network shown in Figure 1, where a network operator has an E2E
   network slice that traverses multiple technology-specific networks.
   Each of these networks might use any number of technologies,
   including but not limited to IP, MPLS, Fiber-Optics (e.g.  WDM,
   DWDM), Passive Optical Networking (PON), Microwave, etc.

   Each of these networks includes multiple (physical or virtual) nodes
   and may also provide network functions beyond simply carrying of
   technology-specific protocol data units.  The types of nodes used in
   any of these networks may include:

   o  Packet/frame processing nodes (e.g., Routers, Switches)

   o  Application servers

   o  Service Functions(e.g., Firewall, Loadbalancer)

   o  Radio Access Network (RAN) components

   o  Mobile Core components

   o  Microwave transceivers

   o  Optical repeaters

   o  etc.

   Each network may support different technologies and an E2E network
   slice is a combination of these networks.  As an example:

   o  Network 1 might contain multiple 5G RAN nodes connected to a few
      Cell Site Gateways (CSG) routers.

   o  Network 2 might have one or more layer-3 routers and layer-2
      switches which may run on top of an optical network.

   o  Network 3 might have a number of 5G RAN nodes connected to Passive
      Optical Network (PON) switches.

                        Figure 1: E2E network slice

   Referring to Figure 1, when operator-z creates a specific E2E network
   slice, it may create one or more of transport slices and other slices
   (application logic or other system functions).

   Note: defining the other slices is out-of-scope of the current work.

   To explain the concept of an E2E network slice, consider a network
   operator-z has various customers.  One of the customers needs an
   independent E2E logical network for a service (e.g.  CCTV, autonomous
   driving, HD map, etc.) with a specific network SLO requirement e.g. a
   secure connection with an E2E latency less than 5ms, from End User-x
   (EU-x) to End User-y (EU-y).  This E2E logical network is called an
   "E2E network slice".  A typical example of EU-x maybe a 5G user
   equipment such as an infotainment unit in a car, CCTV, or a car for
   autonomous driving, etc. and a typical example of EU-y in 5G is 5G
   application server, IMS, etc.

   In Figure 1, "E2E NS" shows the logical network with requested SLO
   for EU-x to EU-y.  It is important to consider that an "E2E network
   slice" is associated with a customer and a specific service type
   (e.g.  CCTV service, autonomous driving, etc.).

   As a concrete example, a customer "City of NY" would like to connect
   all its CCTV cameras for the entire city to one or more locations for
   viewing or collection.  To this end, it requests local carrier -
   'operator-z' in NY to create a new E2E network slice with a bandwidth
   no-less-than 10Mbps from each CCTV coverage area.  In this case, a

   single E2E network slice will be created by the operator-z for the
   customer "City of NY", service type of CCTV and requested bandwidth
   connecting all the CCTV camera zones to one or more control-centers
   for the collection of video data.

   It may also be possible that more than one customer and/or service
   types are associated with an E2E network slice.  For instance, an E2E
   network slice is associated with not only to service type CCTV but
   another service "Public Safety", i.e. NS ID 10 is used for two
   services for "City of NY".

4.  Definition and Scope of Transport slice

4.1.  Transport Slice Definition

   The basic definition of a transport slice is as follows:

   "A transport slice is a logical network topology connecting a number
   of endpoints and a set of shared or dedicated network resources,
   which are used to satisfy specific Service Level Objectives (SLO)".

   Note: The term sub-slice or slice-subnet is used by many standard
   organizations to refer to "Transport Slice" or "Other Slice" (i.e.
   transport sub-slice or transport slice-subnet).  From the IETF point
   of view, these terms are all equivalent.  We will use the term
   "slice" in this document (i.e. use transport slice)

   SLOs are used to clearly describe different network resources
   associated with the service delivered and corresponding parameters
   necessary to realize the transport slice.

   Transport slice should be technology-agnostic, and the means for
   realization can be chosen depending on several factors such as
   service requirements, specifications or capabilities of underlying
   infrastructure.  The structure and different characteristics of
   transport slices are described in the following sections.

4.2.  Transport Slice Structure

   A transport slice has a set of connections and various endpoints to
   form a logical network.  The goal is to achieve specific SLO for a
   customer as shown in Figure 2.  The endpoints may be user equipment,
   any physical or virtual network functions (PNF/VNF), or any network
   service for that matter.  Similarly, connections may be virtual or
   physical links of any type of technology.

                         Figure 2: Transport slice

   Figure 2 illustrates a case where a single transport slice provides
   connectivity between any pair of endpoints with specific
   characteristics for SLO (i.e., assuring B/W to at least x bps and
   transmission delay to be less than y ms).  The endpoints may be
   distributed in the underlay networks, and transport slice can be
   deployed across multiple network domains.  Also, the endpoints on the
   same transport slice may belong to the same address space.

   As shown in Figure 1, an E2E network slice might have one or more of
   "Transport Slices" and one or more of "Other Slices" of any
   combinations.  The "Transport Slices" provides various connections
   with certain SLO between various endpoints whereas the transport
   slice realization addresses its implementation using various
   technologies.  In short, the structure of a transport slice involves
   both definition and its realization.

   A transport slice is built based on a request from a higher
   operations system.  The interface to higher operations systems should
   be technology-agnostic, and slice customers don't need to recognize
   concrete configurations based on the technologies (e.g being more
   declarative than imperative).  The request to instantiate a transport
   slice is represented with some indicators such as SLO, and
   technologies are selected and managed accordingly.

Internet-Draft   draft-rokui-transport-slice-definition       March 2020


   Furthermore, the structure of transport slices may be layered
   vertically or composed horizontally, i.e. operationally, a transport
   slice maybe decomposed in two or more transport slices which are then
   independently realized and managed.  This is further described in
   Section 5.3.

4.2.1.  Stakeholders

   A transport slice and its realization involves the following
   stakeholders and it is relevant to define them for consistent
   terminology.

   Customer or User:  A customer is a user of network slice and hence a
      user of transport slice.  Customers may request for monitoring of
      associated resources or specific changes to them.  A user may
      either directly manage its service by interfacing with the
      transport slice controller or indirectly through an orchestrator.

   Orchestrator:  An orchestrator is an entity that aggregates different
      services, resource and network requirements.  It interfaces on
      behalf of a user with the transport slice controllers and hence a
      user of a transport slice.  Customers may request for monitoring
      of associated resources or specific changes to them.

   Transport Slice Controller:  A transport slice operator (or slice
      operator for short) manages one or more transport slices for one
      or more customers using a Transport Slice Controller (TSC). the
      TSC realizes the transport slice in the network, maintains and
      monitors the run-time state of resources and topologies associated
      with it.  A well-defined interface is needed between different
      types of transport slice controller and different types of
      orchestrator.

   Transport Network Controller:  A transport network controller is a
      traditional network infrastructure controller that offers network
      resources to TSC to be used for the realization of a particular
      transport slice.  These are existing network controllers for a
      specific technology to realize transport slices in its network.

4.2.2.  Transport Slice Controller Interfaces

   To provide common means of provisioning, operating and monitoring the
   transport slices, interactions between different stakeholders should
   be clearly defined.  This happens in two parts with reference to the
   TSC (see Figure 3).

   TSC Northbound Interface (NBI):  The TSC Northbound Interface is a
      bidirectional and an asynchronous interface between a higher level



Rokui, et al.           Expires September 5, 2020               [Page 8]

      system, e.g.  'E2E network slice orchestrator' and the 'Transport
      slice controller'.  It is a technology agnostic interface to
      generalize the deployment of different types of transport slices.
      Different network orchestrators can use the same NBI with the TSC.

   TSC Southbound Interface (SBI):  The TSC Southbound interface is a
      bidirectional and an asynchronous interface between 'Transport
      slice controller' and network controller(s).  These interfaces are
      technology-specific and can utilize many of the existing data
      models such as L2SM, L3SM, VPN, etc.  The TSC maintains mappings
      of network and connectivity resources allocated by one or more
      network controllers.

4.2.3.  Transport slice Realization

   Realization of a Transport Slice is a mapping of underlying
   infrastructure with its definition.  It is technology specific entity
   that is created and maintained over southbound interfaces.  The
   Network controller(s) export the connectivity and resource mappings
   to the TSC.  The network controller abstracts the details of
   underlying resources from the TSC.

   The realization may be achieved in the form of either physical or
   logical connectivity through VPNs, a variety of tunneling
   technologies such as segment routing, SFC, etc.  Accordingly,
   endpoints may be realized as physical or logical service or network
   functions.

5.  Transport Slice System Characteristics

   The characteristics here describe the properties and main
   functionality related to different components of a system that
   supports transport slices.

5.1.  Service Level Objectives on Transport Slice

   A transport slice is defined in terms of several quantifiable
   objectives or SLOs.  These objectives define a set of what network
   resource parameters or values necessary to provide a service a given
   transport slice.  SLOs need not concern with 'how' will they get
   implemented or realized in the underlying networks.  They may be
   defined along the dimensions of operations (time, capacity,
   compute...), reliability and, availability attributes.  A non-
   exhaustive list of characteristics types for transport slice is
   described below:

   o  Guaranteed Bandwidth: assurance of minimum or range of the
      bandwidth requirement.  Requested unidirectionally. .

   o  Guaranteed Latency: maximum permissible network delay when
      transmitting between source and destination endpoints.  Requested
      unidirectionally.  The latency is measured in terms of network
      characteristics (excluding application level latency).

   o  Minimal permissible jitter: packet delay variation (PDV) as
      defined by [RFC3393] is measured by the difference in the one-way
      delay between selected packets in a flow.  Minimizing variations
      in the delay are important for real-time applications, therefore,
      jitter-prevention parameter provide minimal permissible jitter
      expectations for a flow.

   o  Packet loss rate: To specify permissible packet loss rate between
      two endpoints.  For critical networks, this number will be very
      close to zero.

   o  NF resources: The endpoints in Section 5.2 performance depend on
      resource allocated to those functions and can be specified in
      terms of compute, memory and access control objectives points.

   o  Availability: concerns with how quickly network becomes available
      after a fault.  The requirements are specified through Meant time
      between failures (MTBF), and Mean time to repair (MTTR) to acquire
      availability metrics.

   o  Resource redundancy: represents reliability attributes in which a
      backup or duplicate resources such as path (same SLOs - latency,
      bandwidth, etc.), network functions (same compute, memory, etc.)
      To meet no packet loss objective, packet replication maybe
      necessary to guarantee that atleast packets from one path was
      achieved.  However, we should consider this as 'how' aspect of
      objective and not 'what'.

   o  Security: The objective of securing a transport slice concern with
      three attributes: a) end-to-end encryption between source and
      destination endpoints, this can be seen as the logical link
      between source and destination end points requiring encryption, b)
      Authentication and access control (ACLs) objectives to permit data
      on this transport slice, c) Isolation, is also a characteristic of
      security, to prevent interference between two or more slices or
      other flows on the same infrastructure.  Isolation is implied by
      the definition of transport slice itself (logical
      partitioning...).

   o  etc.

   The framework may further specify mechanisms for the performance,
   assurance and monitoring of these objectives.

   Note: Additional objectives may be necessary to capture, such as
   specifying well defined paths or domains that a slice may transit
   through.  A transport slice will carry multiple flows between the 2
   endpoints, therefore objectives should also say if they are
   aggregates or on per flow basis and in such case to be specific
   enough for the system to be able to identify these specifics (subset
   of flows).

   Further description of a set of measurable attributes is captured in
   [I-D.contreras-teas-slice-nbi].

   SLA vs SLO discussion: In defining transport slices, the term SLO
   instead of SLA is used even though SLAs are more commonly used term
   by the operators.  SLOs are definitive and measurable parameters
   associated with a service, therefore, network resource and
   connectivity requirements are defined accurately.  In contrast,
   service level agreements represent contracts for a service between a
   service provider and a service consumer (or subscriber).  Providers
   then translate SLA into SLO; these translations vary from one service

   provider to the other.  Therefore, all through within the scope of
   transport slices term SLO will be used.

5.1.1.  Isolation discussion

   Slice isolation means that the behavior and performance of one
   transport slice does not impact other slices running over the same
   underlying infrastructure or logically shared network resources.
   When the shared resource pools begin to become saturated, SLO
   violations can happen, impacting the performance or operation of
   service associated with the transport slice.  Since the transport
   slices are logically partitioned over the shared resources, a certain
   degree of isolation is expected.  The degree of isolation can be
   derived from availability characteristics requested.

   When realizing a transport slice, the network controller should be
   responsible for allocating and providing resources isolation as
   requested to that slice.  But we have also said that the network
   controllers need not understand the transport slice concept.  It
   maybe simply fulfilling the resource request from the upper layer
   entity without knowing it is realizing a transport slice with strict
   SLOs.  In that case, it may become necessary for a TSC to explicitly
   ask for isolation to prevent any SLO violations.

   SLO violations can occur for two reasons and corresponding statements
   apply

   o  Shared resource interference: i.e. multiple transport slices
      simultaneously share the same resource, and one of them consume
      the resource in surplus.  If the SLO guarantees are strictly
      required, then the network controller can be informed about the
      requirement using hard- or soft- type of isolations (the terms
      hard- and soft- isolation are reused from
      [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn]).

      *  Hard isolation: an SLO for a transport slice is always
         guaranteed.  The network controller will strictly dedicate
         resource to the transport slice (i.e. it will not be shared).

      *  Soft isolation: an SLO violation for a transport slice may
         happen due to resource interference.  In such cases, the
         transport slice's resource usage will be maintained by the
         controller within a certain tolerance level of that
         objectective.

   o  Resource failure or fault occurs.

Internet-Draft   draft-rokui-transport-slice-definition       March 2020


      *  Restoration isolation: the network is not impacted for a period
         longer than the given time.  For example, failover or the
         service restoration takes no longer than some number of
         seconds.  This is specified by Availability SLO.

      *  Protection isolation: the network path is protected with
         specified backup path.  This is specified by Availability SLO.

   Now, the question to resolve at design is whether hard or soft
   parameters be associated with each SLO individually or is a
   characteristic of an entire transport slice.

   Author's Note: This discussion is deferred to the framework document.

   We consider fault-related isolations as part of the specification in
   SLOs.

5.2.  Endpoint Variation

   Transport slice endpoints are the terminating or originating nodes
   requiring connectivity with specific SLO.  Endpoints may be devices
   or functions.

5.2.1.  Types of Endpoints

   There are two types of endpoints based on the functions they perform.

   Transport type EP:  This type of end point performs forwarding
      customer payload without any modification.  E.g. routers,
      switches.

   Service type EP:  This type of endpoint manipulates, processes or
      modifies the user data payload (based on policies).  A non-
      exhaustive list of service functions includes: firewalls, WAN and
      application acceleration, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), server
      load balancers, NAT44 [RFC3022], NAT64 [RFC6146], HTTP header
      enrichment functions, and TCP optimizers.  The generic term "L4-L7
      services" is often used to describe such service functions (SFs).

   This document leverages the term Network Function (NF) to represent
   both types of endpoints in [I-D.ietf-teas-sf-aware-topo-model].

5.2.2.  Connectivity Patterns

   Endpoints may be connected point to point (P2P), point to multipoint
   (P2MP), multi-point to point (MP2P), or multi-point to multi-point
   (MP2MP) based on the topology requested by the customer.

Internet-Draft   draft-rokui-transport-slice-definition       March 2020


   P2P pattern:   P2P type of connections are between 2 endpoints like a
      pseudowire, or a logical link.  The interconnections must
      represent the SLOs as requested by the customer.

   P2MP/MP2P/MP2MP patterns:   P2MP/MP2P/MP2MP type connections will
      interconnect two or more endpoints together (one to many, many to
      one, many to many), representing an abstract topology or graph.
      When describing P2MP/MP2P/MP2MP scenarios it should be possible
      for each logical link to have different SLO than the other link in
      the same graph.

5.3.  Vertical Transport Slice

   Transport slice may follow a hierarchical relationship that would
   provide a vertical structure to it.  This is used for building multi-
   layer slices in which each layer provides an abstraction, as well as
   an independent monitoring, performance, control and management of the
   resources.  The vertical transport slice characteristic maybe used in
   2 forms:

   o  The Transport slice itself where it represents a hierarchy of
      abstracted transport slices.  In this case, realization will be
      done just once with a particular technology.  Thus, the lowest
      transport slice in the hierarchy that can not be decomposed
      further will be one to one mapping to its instance of realized
      transport slice.

   o  Each layer (physical, datalink, or IP) has its own set of
      resources that can be provided to the upper layer as a transport
      slice.  Thus, transport slice at one layer is used by the layer
      above.  This type of multi-layer vertical transport slice
      associates resources at different layers.  For example, an IP
      transport slice would utilize one or more optical transport slice.
      In this case, realization will be done for a particular technology
      at that particular layer.  Thus, the lowest transport slice in
      this type of hierarchy that can not be decomposed further will be
      an instance of realized physical layer transport slice.

       Figure 4: Transport Slice Vertical and Horizontal Composition

   Figure 4 shows the transport slice hierarchy.  Slices TS11 and TS12
   are composed together to form TS1 that is the top level transport
   slice definition, TS121 and TS122 collectively define TS12.  The SLO
   for bandwidth guarantee will be shared and latency guarantee will be
   split into latency in networks 2 and 3.  To emphasize the
   hierarchical structure, consider Network-2 and Network-3 are in the
   same administrative domain but use different transport technologies
   SR and L2VPN respectively.  Then instead of presenting 2 transport
   slices, Operator-z can expose only one transport slice TS12
   abstracting the underlying transport technology details.

      Note: The specification to connect TS121 and TS122 are similar to
      those connecting TS12 and TS11.

5.4.  Horizontal Composition of Transport slice

   In contrast, horizontal transport slices enable the composition of
   multiple realized transport slices.  Since transport slices are not
   necessarily a single encapsulation tunnel and may traverse through
   different data planes, each realized transport slice will require a
   stitching, interworking or mapping function.  These stitching
   functions can be viewed as a type of intermediate network function
   endpoints.  For instance in Figure 4, TS11 and TS12 are horizontal
   transport slices.  If we assume that TS11 is an L2 tunnel and TS12 is
   an SRV6 based path, then a 'Service type EP' (not shown in the
   figure) is needed for translation.

   Author's notes: This service type EP is a new type of transport slice
   specific service function.  We may call it transport slice gateway.
