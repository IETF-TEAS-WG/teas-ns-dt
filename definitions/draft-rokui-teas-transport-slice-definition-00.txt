1.  Introduction

   Network slicing is a methodology to generically describe the logical
   partitioning of network resources associated with a service or an
   application.  Network slicing is expected to enable diverse devices/
   applications which have different requirements on communication to
   coexist on the same network efficiently.  Also, a network slice
   sometimes traverses multiple domains, and generalized interfaces,
   operations, and managements would be important.

   Some key applications which might benefit from the use of network
   slicing include:

   o  5G services (e.g. eMBB, URLLC, mMTC)(See [TS.23.501-3GPP])

   o  Network wholesale

   o  Network infrastructure sharing among the operators

   o  NFV connectivity (Data Center Interconnect)

   A 'network slice' is composed of different endpoints, application
   logic and specific connectivity between them.  Transport slices are a
   part of network slice that fulfills connection requirements between
   endpoints.  Transport slices are created and managed within the scope
   of transport networks (e.g.  IP, MPLS, optical).

   This document provides a definition of slice in transport network
   (called "transport slice"), and describes its characteristics.

3.  High Level Description of End-to-End Network Slicing

   An end-to-end (E2E) network slice is a complete logical network that
   provides a service in its entirety with a specific assurance to the
   customer.  A transport slice concerns those assurance aspects only
   within the transport networks.  To illustrate the IETF definitions of
   both E2E network slice and transport slice, consider the network
   shown in Figure 1, where a network operator has an E2E network slice
   that traverses multiple technology-specific networks.  Each of these
   networks might use any number of technologies, including IP, MPLS,
   Fiber-Optics (e.g.  WDM, DWDM), Passive Optical Networking (PON),
   Microwave, etc.

   Each of these networks includes multiple (physical or virtual) nodes
   and may also provide network functions beyond simply carrying of
   technology-specific protocol data units.  The types of nodes used in
   any of these networks may include:

   o  Packet Switches (e.g., Routers, Bridges)

   o  Application servers

   o  Service Functions(e.g., Firewall, Loadbalancer)

   o  Radio Access Network (RAN) components

   o  Mobile Core components

   o  Microwave transceivers

   o  Optical repeaters

   o  etc.

   Each network may support different technologies and an E2E network
   slice is a combination of these networks.  As an example:

   o  Network 1 might contain multiple 5G RAN nodes connected to a few
      Cell Site Gateways (CSG) routers.

   o  Network 2 might have one or more layer-3 routers and layer-2
      switches which may run on top on an optical network.

   o  Network 3 might have a few 5G RAN nodes connecting to Passive
      Optical Network (PON) switches.

                        Figure 1: E2E network slice

   Referring to Figure 1, when operator-z creates a specific E2E network
   slice, it should create one or more of transport slices and other
   slices (application logic or other network function instances).

   Note: defining the other slices is out-of-scope of the current work.

   To further clarify the concept of E2E network slice, consider the
   network operator-z has various customers.  One of the customers,
   needs a separate and an independent E2E logical network for a service
   (e.g.  CCTV, autonomous driving, HD map, etc.) and has a specific
   network SLO requirement (e.g. a secure connection with an E2E latency
   less than 5ms) from End User-x (EU-x) to End User-y (EU-y) to the
   other side.  This E2E logical network is called an "E2E network
   slice".  A typical example of EU-x in 5G is the User equipment such
   as infotainment unit in the car, CCTV, Car for autonomous driving
   etc. and a typical example of EU-y in 5G is 5G application server,
   IMS etc.

   In Figure 1 we use the term "E2E network slice" to show the logical
   network with requested SLO for EU-x to EU-y.  It is important to
   consider that an "E2E network slice" is associated with a customer
   and a service type (e.g.  CCTV service, autonomous driving etc.).

   For example, a customer "City of NY" would like to connect all its
   CCTV cameras for the entire city to one or more locations for viewing
   or collection.  To this end, it requests local carrier - 'operator-z'
   in NY to create a new E2E network slice with a bandwidth no-less-than

   10Mbps from each CCTV coverage area.  In this case, a single E2E
   network slice will be created by the operator-z for customer "City of
   NY", service type of CCTV and requested bandwidth connecting all the
   CCTV camera zones to one or more control-centers for the collection
   of video data.

   It may also be possible that more than one customer and/or service
   types are associated with an E2E network slice.  For instance, an E2E
   network slice is associated with not only to service type CCTV but
   another service "Public Safety", i.e. NS ID 10 is used for two
   services for City of NY.

4.  Definition and Scope of Transport slice

4.1.  Transport Slice Definition

   The basic definition of a transport slice is as follows:

   "A transport slice is an abstract network topology connecting a
   number of endpoints, with expected objectives specified through a set
   of service level objectives (SLO)".

   Note: The term sub-slice or slice-subnet is used by many standard
   organizations to refer to "Transport Slice" or "Other Slice" (i.e.
   transport sub-slice or transport slice-subnet).  From IETF point of
   view these terms are all equivalent.  We will use term "slice" in
   this document (i.e. use transport slice)

   SLOs are used to clearly describe different network resources and
   corresponding parameters necessary to realize the transport slice.

   Transport slice should be technology-agnostic, and the means for
   realization can be chosen depending on several factors such as
   service requirements, specifications or capabilities of underlaying
   infrastructure.  The structure and different characteristics of the
   transport slice are described in the following sections.

4.2.  Transport Slice Structure

   A transport slice has a set of connections and various endpoints to
   form a logical network.  The goal is to achieve specific SLO for a
   customer as shown in Figure 2.  The endpoints may be user equipment,
   any physical or virtual network functions (PNF/VNF), or any network
   service for that matter.  Similarly, connections may be virtual or
   physical links of any type of technology.

                         Figure 2: Transport slice

   Figure 2 illustrates a case where a single transport slice provides
   connectivity between any pair of endpoints with specific
   characteristic for SLO (i.e., assuring B/W to at least x bps and
   transmission delay to be less than y ms).  The endpoints may be
   disbributed in the underlay networks, and transport slice can be
   deployed across multiple network domains.  Also, the endpoints on the
   same transport slice may belong to the same address space.

   As shown in Figure 1, an E2E network slice might have one or more of
   "Transport Slices" and one or more of "Other Slices" of any
   combinations.  The "Transport Slices" provides various connections
   with certain SLO between various endpoints whereas the transport
   slice realization addresses its implementation using various
   technologies.  In short, the structure of a transport slice involves
   both definition and its realization.

   A "transport slice" addresses a set of technology-agnostic
   connections between various endpoints with certain SLOs.  The
   managing entity or operating stakeholder of a transport slice is
   called a Transport Slice Controller.

   Transport slice realization uses specific technologies in the
   operator's network.  The realization may require allocating

   appropriate resources into one or more networks and a mapping to
   transport slice.  The managing entity realizing a transport slice is
   referred to as network controller.

   A transport slice is built on the basis of request from a higher
   operations system.  The interface to higher operations systems should
   be technology-agnostic, and slice customers don't need to recognize
   concrete configurations based on the technologies.  The request to
   instantiate a transport slice is represented with some indicators
   such as SLO, and technologies are selected and managed accordingly.

   Furthermore, the structure of transport slices may be layered
   vertically or composed horizontally, i.e. operationally, a transport
   slice maybe decomposed in two or more transport slices which are then
   independently realized and managed.  This is further described in
   Section 5.3.

4.2.1.  Stakeholders

   A transport slice and its realization involves the following
   stakeholders and it is relevant to define them for consistent
   terminology.

   Customer or User:  A customer is a user of network slice and hence a
      user of transport slice.  Customers may request for monitoring of
      associated resources or specific changes to them.  A user may
      either directly manage its service by interfacing with the
      transport slice controller or indirectly through an orchestrator.

   Orchestrator:  An orchestrator is an entity that aggregates different
      services, resource and network requirements.  It interfaces on
      behalf of a user with transport slice controller and hence a user
      of transport slice.  Customers may request for monitoring of
      associated resources or specific changes to them.

   Transport Slice Controller:  A transport slice operator (or slice
      operator for short) manages one or more transport slices for one
      or more customers using a Transport Slice Controller (TSC). the
      TSC realizes the transport slice in the network, maintains and
      monitors the run-time state of resources and topologies associated
      with it.  A standard interface is needed between different type of
      The transport slice controller and different types of
      orchestrator.

   Transport Network Controller:  A transport network controller is
      traditional network infrastructure controller that offers network
      resources to TSC to be used for realization of a particular

Internet-Draft   draft-rokui-transport-slice-definition    February 2020


      transport slice.  These are existing network controllers for a
      specific technology to realize transport slices in its network.

4.2.2.  Transport Slice Controller Interfaces

   The above stakeholders help to clearly define the scope and type of
   interfaces necessary to deploy, monitor and manage transport slices.
   The interface between a transport slice controller and network
   controller(s) has to be technology-agnostic, in order to generalize
   deployment of different types of network slice services.  Whereas the
   interface from a network controller to the infrastructure may be
   diverse to support a variety of underlying transport technologies.
   Thus, scope of two types of interfaces are defined as follows:

   TSC Northbound Interface (NBI):  The TSC Northbound Interface is a
      bidirectional interface between a higher level system, e.g.  'E2E
      network slice orchestrator' and the 'Transport slice controller'.
      Differnt types of orchestrators will have a common interface to
      transport slices through NBI.  Operations to create, delete,
      augment and monitor for service assurance of those transport
      slices should be supported through NBI.

   TSC Southbound Interface (SBI):  The TSC Southbound interface is a
      bidirectional interface between 'Transport slice controller' and
      network controller(s).  These interfaces are technology-specific
      and can utilize many of the existing data models such as L2SM,
      L3SM, VPN etc.  They may need extensions to provide additional
      operations to match NBI operations mentioned above.  The TSC
      maintains mappings to network and connectivity resources allocated
      by one or many network controllers.

5.  Transport Slice System Characteristics

   The characteristics here describe the properties and main
   functionality related to different components of a system that
   supports transport slices.

5.1.  Service Level Objectives on Transport Slice

   A transport slice is defined in terms of several quantifiable
   objectives or SLOs.  These objectives define a set of network
   resource parameters or values necessary to provide a service a given
   transport slice.  A non-exhaustive list of characteristics types for
   transport slice is described below:

   o  Guaranteed Bandwidth

   o  Guaranteed Delay

   o  Prevention of Jitter

   o  Reliability (i.e., low packet loss rate)

   o  Availability (i.e., MTBF, MTTR)

   o  Secure network

   o  etc.

   For the definitions of some of the attributes see
   [I-D.contreras-teas-slice-nbi] for further analysis.

   SLA vs SLO discussion: In defining transport slices, the term SLO
   instead of SLA is used even though SLAs are more commonly used term
   by the operators.  SLOs are definitve and measureable parameters
   associated with a service, therefore, network resource and
   connectivity requirements are defined accurately.  In contrast
   service level agreements represent contracts for a service between a
   service provider and a service consumer (or subscriber).  Providers
   then translate SLA into SLO; these translations vary from one service
   provider to the other.  Therefore, all through with in the scope of
   transport slices term SLOs will be used.

   Isolation discussion: There was difference of opinion whether
   isolation should be explicitely demanded by a transport slice as an
   SLO.  However, as long as the primary SLOs such as bandwidth,
   latency, throughput, path-selection, encryption, security etc. meet
   the functionality of a transport slice, it is not necessary to
   explicitly ask for isolation.  We are also aware several underlying
   technologies (e.g.  tunnels) inherently support isolation so it can
   be an implementation requirement not definition.

   Author's Note: Further discussion is deferred to framework document.

5.2.  Endpoint Variation

   Transport slice endpoints are the terminating or originating nodes
   requiring connectivity with specific SLO.  Endpoints may be devices
   or functions.

5.2.1.  Types of Endpoints

   There are two types of endpoints based on the functions they perform.

   Transport type EP:  This type of end point performs forwarding
      customer payload without any modification.  E.g. routers,
      switches.

Internet-Draft   draft-rokui-transport-slice-definition    February 2020


   Service type EP:  This type of endpoint manipulates, process or
      modify the user data payload (based on policies).  A non-
      exhaustive list of service functions includes: firewalls, WAN and
      application acceleration, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), server
      load balancers, NAT44 [RFC3022], NAT64 [RFC6146], HTTP header
      enrichment functions, and TCP optimizers.  The generic term "L4-L7
      services" is often used to describe such service functions (SFs).

   This document leverages the term Network Function (NF) to represent
   both types of endpoints in [I-D.ietf-teas-sf-aware-topo-model].

5.2.2.  Connectivity Patterns

   Endpoints may be connected point to point (P2P), point to multipoint
   (P2MP), multi-point to point (MP2P), or multi-point to multi-point
   (MP2MP) based on the topology requested by the customer.

   P2P pattern:   P2P type of connections are between 2 endpoints like a
      pseudowire, or a logical link.  The interconnections must
      represent the SLOs as requested by the customer.

   P2MP/MP2P/MP2MP patterns:   P2MP/MP2P/MP2MP type connections will
      interconnect two or more endpoints together (one to many, many to
      one, many to many), representing an abstract topology or graph.
      When describing P2MP/MP2P/MP2MP scnearios it should be possible
      for each logical link to have different SLO than the other link in
      the same graph.

5.3.  Vertical Transport Slice

   Transport slice may follow a hierarchical relation that may provide a
   vertical structure to it.  This is used for building multi-layer
   slices in which each layer provides its own abstraction as well as
   independent monitoring, performance, control and management of
   resources.  The vertical transport slice characteristic maybe used in
   2 forms:

   o  The Transport slice itself where it represents hierarchy of
      abstracted transport slices.  In this case realization will done
      just once with a particular technology.  Thus, the lowest
      transport slice in the hierarchy that can not be decomposed
      further will be one to one mapping to its instance of realized
      transport slice.

   o  Each layer (physical, datalink, or IP) has its own set of
      resources that can be provided to upper layer as a transport
      slice.  Thus, transport slice at one layer can be be used by the
      layer above.  This type of multi-layer vertical transport slice

Internet-Draft   draft-rokui-transport-slice-definition    February 2020


      associates resources at different layers.  For example, an IP
      transport slice would utilize one or more optical transport slice.
      In this case realization will done for a particular technology at
      that layer.  Thus, the lowest transport slice in this type of
      hierarchy that can not be decomposed further will be an instance
      of realized physical layer transport slice.

       Figure 4: Transport Slice Vertical and Horizontal Composition

   Figure 4 shows transport slice hierarchy.  Slices TS11 and TS12 are
   composed together to form TS1 the top level transport slice
   definition, TS121 and TS122 collectively define TS12.  The SLO for
   bandwidth guarantee will be shared and latency guarantee will be
   split into latency in networks 2 and 3.  To emphasize the
   hierarchical structure, consider Network-2 and Network-3 are in the
   same administrative domain but use different transport technologies
   SR and L2VPN respectively.  Then instead of presenting 2 transport
   slices, Operator-z can expose only one transport slice TS12 hiding
   the underlying transport technology details.

      Note: The specification to connect TS121 and TS122 are similar to
      those connecting TS12 and TS11.

5.4.  Horizontal Composition of Transport slice

   In contrast, horizontal transport slices enable composition of
   multiple realized transport slices.  Since transport slices are not
   necessarily single tunnel and may traverse through differnt data
   planes, each realized transport slice will require a stitching or
   mapping function.  These stitching functions can be viewed as a type
   of intermediate network function endpoints.  For instance in

Internet-Draft   draft-rokui-transport-slice-definition    February 2020


   Figure 4, TS11 and TS12 are horizonal transport slices.  If we assume
   that TS11 is an L2 tunnel and TS12 is an SRV6 based path, then a
   'Service type EP' (not shown in figure) is needed for translation.

   Author's notes: This service type EP is new type of transport slice
   specific service function.  We may call it transport slice gateway.

6.  Realization of Transport slice

   Realization of a Transport Slice is its integral part and is created
   and maintained over south bound interfaces.  Since realization of
   transport slice is technology specific, it is handled by the network
   controller which also exports these mappings to the TSC.  During
   realization resources are actually allocated leading to instantiation
   of a transport slice in the network.  Network controller hides the
   details of underlying resources from the TSC and exports, logical
   handles to those resources.

   Realization may be achieved in the form of describing either
   physical, logical, or overlay connectivity through VPNs, tunnels,
   segment routing, SFC, etc.  Accordingly end points may be realized as
   physical or logical service or network functions.  As an example, a
   possible candidate technology for building transport slices is
   described in [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn].
