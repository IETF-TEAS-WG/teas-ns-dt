1.  Introduction

   Network slicing is a methodology to generically describe the logical
   partitioning of network resources associated with a service or an
   application.  Network Slicing is considered very useful because there
   is a need to generalize control, operations and management of diverse
   set of services and related resource requirements that can then be
   applied to any number or type of proposed, implemented and/or
   deployed technologies and associated devices.  Some key applications
   which might benefit from the use of network slicing include:

   o  5G services (e.g. eMBB, URLLC, mMTC)(See [TS.23.501-3GPP])

   o  Wholesale business VPN

   o  Network infrastructure sharing among the operators

   o  NFV connectivity (Data Center Interconnect)

   A 'network slice' is composed of different endpoints, application
   logic and specific connectivity between them.  Transport slices are a
   part of network slice that fulfills connection requirements, which
   are created and managed within the scope of transport networks (e.g.
   IP, MPLS, GMPLS).

   This document provides a definition of 'transport slices' in IETF,
   and describes considerations for their realization.

3.  High Level Architecture of End-to-End Network Slicing

   An end-to-end (E2E) network slice is a complete logical network that
   provides a service in its entirety with a specific assurance to the
   customer.  A transport slice concerns those assurance aspects only
   within the transport networks.  To illustrate the IETF definitions of
   both E2E network slice and transport slice, consider the network
   shown in Figure 1, where a network operator has an E2E network slice
   that traverses multiple technology-specific networks.  Each of these
   networks might use any number of technologies, including IP, MPLS,
   Fiber-Optics (e.g.  WDM, DWDM), Passive Optical Networking (PON),
   Microwave, etc.

   Each of these networks includes multiple (physical or virtual) nodes
   and may also provide network functions beyond simply carrying of
   technology-specific protocol data units.  The types of nodes used in
   any of these networks may include:

   o  Packet Switches (e.g.  Routers, Bridges)

   o  Application servers

   o  Firewalls

   o  Radio Access Network (RAN) components

   o  Mobile Core components

   o  Microwave transceivers

   o  Optical repeaters

   o  etc.

   Each network may support different technologies and an E2E network
   slice is a combination of these networks.  As an example:

   o  Network 1 might contain multiple 5G RAN nodes connected to a few
      Cell Site Gateways (CSG) routers.

   o  Network 2 might have one or more layer-3 routers and layer-2
      switches which may run on top on an optical network.

      Optical Network (PON) switches.

                        Figure 1: E2E network slice

   Referring to Figure 1, when operator-z creates a specific E2E network
   slice, it should create one or more of the following two types of
   artefacts:

   o  Transport slice

   o  Other slice (application logic or other non-IETF slice components)

   Note: defining the other slices is out-of-scope of the current work.

   To further clarify the concept of E2E network slice, consider the
   network operator-z has various customers.  One of the customers,
   needs a separate and an independent E2E logical network for a service
   (e.g.  CCTV, autonomous driving, HD map, etc.) and has a specific
   network SLO requirement (e.g. a secure connection with an E2E latency
   less than 5ms) from End User-x (EU-x) to End User-y (EU-y) to the
   other side.  This E2E logical network is called an "E2E network
   slice".  A typical example of EU-x in 5G is the User equipment such
   as infotainment unit in the car, CCTV, Car for autonomous driving
   etc. and a typical example of EU-y in 5G is 5G application server,
   IMS etc.

   In Figure 1 we use the term "E2E network slice" to show the logical
   network with requested SLO for EU-x to EU-y.  It is important to
   consider that an "E2E network slice" is associated with a customer
   and a service type (e.g.  CCTV service, autonomous driving etc.).

   For example, a customer "City of NY" would like to connect all its
   CCTV cameras for the entire city to one or more locations for viewing
   or collection.  To this end, it requests local carrier - 'operator-z'
   in NY to create a new E2E network slice with a bandwidth no-less-than
   10Mbps from each CCTV coverage area.  In this case, a single E2E
   network slice will be created by the operator-z for customer "City of
   NY", service type of CCTV and requested bandwidth connecting all the
   CCTV camera zones to one or more control-centers for the collection
   of video data.

   It may also be possible that more than one customer and/or service
   types are associated with an E2E network slice.  For instance, an E2E
   network slice is associated with not only to service type CCTV but
   another service "Public Safety", i.e. NS ID 10 is used for two
   services for City of NY.

4.  IETF Definition and Scope of Transport slice

4.1.  Transport Slice Definition

   [RFC8453] defines a virtual network as a customer view of the
   physical network topology that can be expressed or as a set of 
   edge-to-edge abstract link, called VN members, or customer can ask
   a more detailed view of VN member than can be described in terms of 
   virtual nodes and virtual links.
   In both cases VN can be considered as built up on top of an 
   abstracted topology representing potential connectivity of 
   the underlying network as described in [RFC7926] section 2.3.1. 

   The basic definition of a transport slice can be as follows:
   A transport network slice is a virtual network with a particular
   network topology and a set of shared or dedicated network resources,
   which are used to provide the network slice consumer with the
   required connectivity, appropriate isolation and 
   specific Service Level Agreement (SLA) or Service Level Objective (SLO).

   

   Note: The term sub-slice or slice-subnet is used by many standard
   organizations to refer to "Transport Slice" or "Other Slice" (i.e.
   transport sub-slice or transport slice-subnet).  From IETF point of
   view these terms are all equivalent.  We will use term "slice" in
   this document (i.e. use transport slice)

   SLOs are used to clearly describe different network resources and
   corresponding parameters necessary to realize the transport slice.

   Transport slice should be technology-agnostic, and the means for
   realization can be chosen depending on several factors such as
   service requirements, specifications or capabilities of underlaying
   infrastructure.  The structure and different characteristics of the
   transport slice are described in the following sections.

4.2.  Overview of Transport Slice Structure

   A transport slice has a set of connections and various endpoints to
   form a logical network.  The goal is to achieve specific SLO for a
   customer as shown in Figure 2.  The endpoints may be user equipment,
   any physical or virtual network functions (PNF/VNF), or any network
   service for that matter.  Similarly, connections may be virtual or
   physical links of any type of technology.

                         Figure 2: Transport slice

   Figure 2 illustrates a case where a single transport slice provides
   connectivity between "m" endpoints on left-hand side to "n" endpoints
   on right-hand side with specific characteristic for SLO (i.e.,
   assuring B/W to at least x bps and transmission delay to be less than
   y ms).

   As shown in Figure 1, an E2E network slice might have one or more of
   "Transport Slices" and one or more of "Other Slices" of any
   combinations.  The "Transport Slices" provides various connections
   with certain SLO between various endpoints whereas the transport
   slice realization addresses its implementation using various

   technologies.  In short, the structure of a transport slice involves
   both definition and its realization.

   A "transport slice" addresses a set of technology-agnostic
   connections between various endpoints with certain SLOs.  The
   managing entity or operating stakeholder of a transport slice is
   called a Slice operator.

   "Transport slice realization" is the use of a specific technology to
   realize the SLOs in the operator's network.  While the transport
   slice itself is technology agnostic, its realization is technology
   specific.  A transport slice may be realized by allocating
   appropriate resources into one or more networks.  The managing entity
   realizing a transport slice is referred to as realizing network
   operator in this document.

   A transport slice is built with a combination of specific
   technologies on the basis of request from a higher operations system.
   The interface to higher operations systems should be technology-
   agnostic, and slice customers don't need to recognize concrete
   configurations based on the technologies.  The request to instantiate
   a transport slice is represented with some indicators such as SLO,
   and technologies are selected and managed accordingly.

   Furthermore, the structure of transport slices may be hierarchical,
   i.e. operationally, a transport slice at one level maybe decomposed
   in two or more transport slices which are then independently realized
   and managed.  This is further described in Section 5.3.

4.2.1.  Stakeholders

   A transport slice and its realization involves the following
   stakeholders and it is relevant to define them for consistent
   terminology.

   Customer or User:  A customer is a user of network slice and hence a
      user of transport slice.  Customers may request for monitoring of
      associated resources or specific changes to them.  A user may
      either directly manage its service by interfacing with the
      transport slice controller or indirectly through an orchestrator.

   Orchestrator:  An orchestrator is an entity that aggregates different
      services, resource and network requirements.  It interfaces on
      behalf of a user with transport slice controller and hence a user
      of transport slice.  Customers may request for monitoring of
      associated resources or specific changes to them.

Internet-Draft draft-nsdt-teas-transport-slice-definition   January 2020


   Transport Slice Controller:  A transport slice operator (or slice
      operator for short) manages one or more transport slices for one
      or more customers using a Transport Slice Controller (TSC). the
      TSC realizes the transport slice in the network, maintains and
      monitors the run-time state of resources and topologies associated
      with it.  A standard interface is needed between different type of
      The transport slice controller and different types of
      orchestrator.

   Transport Network Controller:  A transport network controller is
      traditional network infrastructure controller that offers network
      resources to TSC to be used for realization of a particular
      transport slice.  These are existing network controllers for a
      specific technology to realize transport slices in its network.

4.2.2.  Transport Slice Controller Interfaces

   Authur's Note: The discussion below is not complete/consistent yet in
   context of NBI needs further discussion and review.  Also figure may
   be too detailed for definitions document.  Consider removing.

   The above stakeholders help to clearly define the scope and type of
   interfaces necessary to deploy, monitor and manage transport slices.
   The interface between a transport slice controller and network
   controller(s) has to be technology-agnostic, in order to generalize
   deployment of different types of network slice services.  Whereas the
   interface from a network controller to the infrastructure may be
   diverse to support a variety of underlying transport technologies.
   Thus, scope of two types of interfaces are defined as follows:

   o  The TSC Northbound Interface is a bidirectional interface between
      'A higher level system (e.g.  E2E network slice orchestrator)' and
      the 'Transport slice controller'(see section X.X for TSC).  Using
      NBI information, The TSC carries the mapping to specific
      technologies for its realization.  It is aware of the generalized
      network resources, and links . Additionally, operations to augment
      and monitor those transport slices are also supported over NBI.

   o  The TSC Southbound interface is a bidirectional interface between
      'Transport slice controller' and network controller(s).  These
      interfaces are technology-specific and can utilize many of the
      existing data models such as L2SM, L3SM, VPN etc [add ref].  They
      may need extensions to provide additional operations to match NBI
      operations.

5.  Transport Slice System Characteristics

   The characteristics here describe the properties and main
   functionality related to different components of a system that
   supports transport slices.

5.1.  Service Level Objectives on Transport Slice

   A transport slice is defined in terms of several quantifiable
   objectives or SLOs.  These objectives define a set of network
   resource parameters or values necessary to provide a service a given
   transport slice.  A non-exhaustive list of characteristics types for
   transport slice is described below:

   o  Guaranteed Bandwidth

   o  Guaranteed Delay

   o  Prevention of Jitter

Internet-Draft draft-nsdt-teas-transport-slice-definition   January 2020


   o  High Reliability (i.e., low packet loss rate)

   o  High Availability (i.e., MTBF, MTTR)

   o  Secure network

   o  etc.

   For the definitions of some of the attributes see
   [I-D.contreras-teas-slice-nbi] for further analysis.

   SLA discussion: The scope IETF transport slice definition and its
   control is to provide the transport slice realizing entity with the
   parameters that make up the relevant service details.  In contrast
   the concept of a service level agreement represents a contract for a
   service between a service provider and a service consumer (or
   subscriber), a translation of SLA to SLO is not in the scope of IETF.
   Transport slices concern with parametric guarantees of the type
   defined above.

   Isolation discussion: SLO sufficiently specifies a transport slice.
   For example, an SLO need not explicitly ask for isolation since it is
   implied by guarantees of network resources.  In fact a number of
   isolation technologies (TE, RSVP, VPN, VXLAN, IntServ etc.) are means
   to realize transport slices in the underlay networks.  It is also
   implied that the forwarding, policy and address spaces are local with
   in a transport slice and instantiation of one slice does not conflict
   with another slice.  This can be enforced as hard or soft level of
   resource allocations.  The appropriate level is selected based on the
   specified SLOs.

5.2.  Endpoint Variation

   Transport slice endpoints are the terminating or originating nodes
   requiring connectivity with specific SLO.  Endpoints may be devices
   or functions.

5.2.1.  Types of Endpoints

   There are two types of endpoints based on the functions they perform.

   Transport type EP:  This type of end point performs forwarding
      customer payload without any modification.  E.g. routers,
      switches.

   Service type EP:  This type of endpoint manipulates, process or
      modify the user data payload (based on policies).  A non-
      exhaustive list of service functions includes: firewalls, WAN and

      application acceleration, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), server
      load balancers, NAT44 [RFC3022], NAT64 [RFC6146], HTTP header
      enrichment functions, and TCP optimizers.  The generic term "L4-L7
      services" is often used to describe such service functions (SFs).

   This document leverages the term Network Function (NF) to represent
   both types of endpoints in draft-ietf-teas-sf-aware-topo-model.

5.2.2.  Connectivity Patterns

   Endpoints may be connected point to point or point to multipoint
   based on the topology requested by the customer.

   o  P2P type of connections are between 2 endpoints like a pseudowire,
      or a logical link.  The interconnections must represent the SLOs
      as requested by the customer.

   o  MP2P type connections will interconnect two or more endpoints
      together (one to many, many to one, many to many), representing an
      abstract topology or graph.  When describing MP2P scnearios it
      should be possible for each logical link to have different SLO
      than the other link.

5.3.  Vertical Transport Slice

   Transport slice may follow a hierarchical relation that may provide a
   vertical structure to it.  This is used for building multi-layer
   slices and each layer providing its own independent monitoring,
   performance, control and management of resources.  The vertical
   transport slice characteristic maybe used in 2 forms:

   o  The Transport slice itself where it represents hierarchy of
      abstracted transport slices.  In this case realization will done
      just once with a particular technology.  Thus, the lowest
      transport slice in the hierarchy that can not be decomposed
      further will be one to one mapping to its instance of realized
      transport slice.

   o  Since a transport slice is a set of resources, not just VPN or TE
      tunnel, the realization of a transport slice may be also
      hierarchical.  This type of multi-layer vertical transport slice
      associates resources at different layers.  For example, an IP
      transport slice would utilize one or more optical transport slice.
      In this case realization will done for a particular technology at
      that layer.  Thus, the lowest transport slice in this type of
      hierarchy that can not be decomposed further will be an instance
      of realized physical layer transport slice.

                    Figure 4: Transport Slice Hierarchy

   Figure 4 shows transport slice hierarchy.  Slices TS11 and TS12 are
   composed together to form TS1 the top level transport slice
   definition, TS121 and TS122 collectively define TS12.  The SLO for
   bandwidth guarantee will be shared and latency guarantee will be
   split into latency in networks 2 and 3.  To emphasize the
   hierarchical structure, consider Network-2 and Network-3 are in the
   same administrative domain but use different transport technologies
   SR and L2VPN respectively.  Then instead of presenting 2 transport
   slices, Operator-z can expose only one transport slice TS12 hiding
   the underlying transport technology details.

      Note: The specification to connect TS121 and TS122 are similar to
      those connecting TS12 and TS11.

5.4.  Horizonal Composition of Transport slice

   In contrast, horizontal transport slices enable composition of
   multiple realized transport slices.  Since transport slices are not
   necessarily single tunnel and may traverse through differnt data
   planes, each realized transport slice will require a stitching or
   mapping function.  These stitching functions can be viewed as a type
   of intermediate network function endpoints.  For instance in
   Figure 4, TS11 and TS12 are horizonal transport slices.  If we assume
   that TS11 is an L2 tunnel and TS12 is an SRV6 based path, then a
   'Service type EP' (not shown in figure) is needed for translation.

   Author's notes: This service type EP is new type of transport slice
   specific service function.  We may call it transport slice gateway.

6.1.  Transport Slice Examples

6.1.1.  Scenario-1

   Figure 5 depicts an example of transport slice connecting two 5G RAN
   nodes (gNB) to three 5G Core user plan function nodes (UPF).  In this
   case a transport slice 20 is created with SLA including 10 [msec], or
   better, latency between 5G endpoints gNBs and UPFs.

6.1.3.  Scenario-3

   Another example of transport slice is SFC case as shown in Figure 7
   and Figure 8 which depict an example with SF1 and SF2 (e.g.  DPI,
   Firewall, WAF, video optimizer, content cache server, NAT/CGN, Load
   balancer) and the transport slice between ER1 and ER2 traverses these
   SFs.  There are two approaches:

   o  Approach-1 shown in Figure 7 where Transport slice 40 chains
      router ER1, SF1, SF2, and router ER2.  Transport slice 40 needs
      lower than 30 ms delay.  However, endpoints SF1 and SF2 are
      implicitly identified during the transport slice realization.  In
      this case, a single transport slice is created between ER1 and
      ER2.

   o  Approach-2 shown in Figure 8 where the transport slice 40 can be
      broken into transport slices 41, 42, 43.  In this case SF1 and SF2
      are explicityly identified and as a results three transport slices
      between following endpoints will be realized:

      *  Between endpoints ER1 and SF1

      *  Between endpoints SF1 and SF2

      *  Between endpoints SF2 and ER2

6.2.  Considerations on Realization

   A Transport Slice has another aspect which is its realization in the
   operator's network as shown in Figure 9.  The creaton of a new
   Transport Slice will be initiated with follwoing 3 Steps:

   Step 1:  A higher level system requests connections with specific
      characteristics via NBI.

   Step 2:  This request will be processed by a Transport Slice
      Controller which specifies a mapping between northbound request to
      any IETF Services, Tunnels, and paths models.

   Step 3:  A series of requests for creaton of services, tunnels and
      paths will be sent to the network to realize the trasport slice.

                   Figure 9: Transport Slice Realization

6.2.1.  Realization of Scenario-1

   Figure 10 depicts the realization of the transport slice 20 of
   Figure 5.  Operator's transport slice controller invoke an abstract
   API to create a transport slice between 5G endpoints gNB1 and gNB2 to
   5G Core endpoints UPF1, UPF2 and UPF3 with SLA inlcuding 10 [ms]
   latency.

   Since in most cases the passed in endpoints (i.e. 5G RAN and 5G Core
   endpoints) cannot support any IP/MPLS/Optics services, the endpoints
   to realize the transport slice 20 will not be the endpoints passed

   in.  This is one of the most important aspects to consider when
   realizing the transport slices.

   As shown in Figure 10, the realization of transport slice 20 required
   the transport slice controller to find out the "best" endpoints which
   support the realization of transport slice 20 in the network, i.e.
   endpoints ER1, ER2 and ER3.  After that, the realization of the
   transport slice 20 will be initiated by creation of various
   services/tunnels/paths between edge routers ER1, ER2 and ER3.  The
   type of Services/Tunnels/Paths depends on the supported technologies
   of endpoints ER1, ER2 and ER3.

   In this scenario, the end points of transport slice realization are
   not those endpoints passed in, i.e.

   o  Definition of transport slice is between gNB1 and gNB2 to UPF1,
      UPF2, and UPF3

   o  Realization of transport slice is between edge routers ER1, ER2
      and ER3

   transport slice.  For example, if both network functions (i.e.  R1,
   FW1, FW2) and network supports segment routing, two Tunnels/Services
   of type SR can be created (or used) in the network between R1, FW1
   and FW2 to realise the transport slice 30.  However, if the network
   just supports RSVP, two tunnels/services of type RSVP can be used to
   realize this transport slice.

   Note that since the network functions ER1, FW1 and FW2 support
   segment routing, the endpoints of the tunnels in this example are
   those endpointss passed in, i.e. the endpoints of the both transport
   slice definiton and its realization are R1, FW1 and FW2:

   o  Definition of transport slice is between network functions R1 to
      FW1 and FW2

   o  Realization of transport slice is between network functions R1 to
      FW1 and FW2

   We will see in next example that in some scenarios this is not the
   case and the endpoints of Transport Slice definition might be
   different from endpoints of its realization of transport slices.

   It is very clear that regardless of how transport slice is realized
   in the network (i.e. using tunnels of type RSVP or SR), the
   definition of transport slice 30 does not change at all but rather
   its realization.

6.2.3.  Realization of Scenario-3

   Figure 12 depicts the realization of the transport slice 40 of
   Figure 7 where a transport slice needed between network functions R1
   and R2 across SF1 and SF2.  However, the location of SF1 and SF2 are
   decided internally with a logic in Transport Slice Controller.  For
   example, when SLA requires the high secure transport slice between
   ER1 and ER2 which in turn results on adding SF1 and SF2 to the

   realization of transport slice 40 implicitly by transport slice
   controller.

   Figure 13 shows the realization of the transport slice 40 of
   Figure 8.  In this case the location of SF1 and SF2 has been
   explicitly decided by higher level logic.  In this case three
   transport slices 41, 42 and 43 will be created separately and
   eventually bind together to form a single transport slice 40 to meet
   the SLA that delay is lower than 30 ms.
