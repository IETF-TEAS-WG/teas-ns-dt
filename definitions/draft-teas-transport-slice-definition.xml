   This document provides a definition of the term "IETF Network Slice" for
   use within the IETF and specifically as a reference for other IETF documents that
   describe or use aspects of network slices.
</t>

      <t>
    A number of use cases benefit from network connections that along with the connectivity provide assurance of meeting a specific set of 
        objectives wrt network resources use. In this document, as detailed in the subsequent sections, we refer to this connectivity and resource commitment 
        as an IETF Network Slice. Services that might benefit from the network slices include but not limited to:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>5G services (e.g. eMBB, URLLC, mMTC)(See <xref target="TS.23.501-3GPP"/>)</t>
          <t>Network wholesale services</t>
          <t>Network infrastructure sharing among operators</t>
          <t>NFV connectivity and Data Center Interconnect</t>
        </list>
       </t>

<t> The use cases are further described in <xref target="I-D.nsdt-teas-ns-framework"/>.
</t>

<t>
 This document defines the concept of IETF network slices that provide
 connectivity coupled with a set of specific commitments of network resources between a number
  of endpoints over a shared network infrastructure.  Since the term
  network slice is rather generic, the qualifying term 'IETF' is used in
  this document to limit the scope of network slice to network
  technologies described and standardized by the IETF. 
</t>

<!--  <section title="Rationale"> -->

<t> 
   IETF network slices are created and managed within the scope of one
   or more network technologies (e.g., IP, MPLS, optical).  They are
   intended to enable a diverse set of applications that have different
   requirements to coexist on the shared network infrastructure.  A
   request for an IETF network slice is technology-agnostic so as to
   allow a consumer to describe their network connectivity objectives in
   a common format, independent of the underlying technologies used.

 <section title="Definition and Scope of IETF Network Slice">

 <t>
 The definition of a network slice in IETF context is as follows:
</t>
<t>
 An IETF network slice is a logical network topology connecting a number of 
 endpoints using a set of shared or dedicated network resources 
 that are used to satisfy specific Service Level Objectives (SLOs).
</t>

<t>  
   An IETF network slice combines the connectivity
   resource requirements and associated network behaviors such as bandwidth,
   latency, jitter, and network
   functions with other resource behaviors such as compute and storage availability.  

   IETF network slices are 
   independent of the underlying infrastructure connectivity and
   technologies used.  This is to allow an IETF network slice consumer
   to describe their network connectivity and relevant objectives in a
   common format, independent of the underlying technologies used.
</t>

<t> IETF network slices may be combined hierarchically,
  so that a network slice may itself be sliced.  They may also be
  combined sequentially so that various different networks can each be
  sliced and the network slices placed into a sequence to provide an
  end-to-end service.  This form of sequential combination is utilized
  in some services such as in 3GPP's 5G network <xref target="TS.23.501-3GPP"/>.
</t>

 <t>
  An IETF network slice is technology-agnostic, and the means for IETF  
  network slice realization can be chosen depending on 
  several factors such as: service requirements, specifications or capabilities 
  of underlying infrastructure. The structure and different 
  characteristics of IETF network slices are described in the following  sections.
 </t>
<t>
  Term "Slice" refers to a set of characteristics and behaviours that separate one type of 
   user-traffic from another. 
   IETF network slice assumes that an underlying network is capable of changing 
   the configurations of the network devices on demand, through in-band signaling or via controller(s) and fulfilling all or some of 
   SLOs to all of the traffic in the slice or to specific flows.
       </t>
  
      </section>

    <section anchor="TS-Char" title="IETF Network Slice System Characteristics">

      <t>
      The following subsections describe the characteristics of IETF network slices.
    </t>

        <section title="Objectives for IETF Network Slices">
        <t>
      An IETF network slice is defined in terms of several quantifiable characteristics or service level objectives (SLOs). SLOs along with terms Service Level Indicator (SLI) and Service Level Agreement (SLA) are used to define the performance of a service at different levels. 
</t>

<t>A Service Level Indicator (SLI) is a quantifiable measure of an
  aspect of the performance of a network.  For example, it may be a
   measure of throughput in bits per second, or it may be a measure of
   latency in milliseconds.
</t>
<t>
   A Service Level Objective (SLO) is a target value or range for the
   measurements returned by observation of an SLI.  For example, an SLO
   may be expressed as "SLI &lt;= target", or "lower bound &lt;= SLI &lt;= upper
   bound".  A network slice is expressed in terms of the set of SLOs
   that are to be delivered for the different connections between
   endpoints.
</t>
<t>
   A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is an explicit or implicit contract
   between the consumer of an IETF network slice and the provider of
   the slice.  The SLA is expressed in terms of a set of SLOs and may
   include commercial terms as well as the consequences of missing/violating the
   SLOs they contain.
</t>
   
 <t>
   Additional descriptions of IETF network slice attributes is covered
   in <xref target="I-D.contreras-teas-slice-nbi"/>.
 </t>

<section anchor="SLO" title=" Service Level Objectives">

<t>
  SLOs define a set of network attributes and characteristics that describe an IETF network
  slice.  SLOs do not describe 'how' the IETF network slices are
  implemented or realized in the underlying network layers.  Instead,
  they are defined in terms of dimensions of operation (time, capacity,
  etc.), availability, and other attributes.  An IETF network slice can
  have one or more SLOs associated with it.  The SLOs are combined in
  an SLA.  The SLOs are defined for sets of two or more endpoints and
  apply to specific directions of traffic flow.  That is, they apply to
  specific source endpoints and specific connections between endpoints
  within the set of endpoints and connections in the network slice.
</t>
</section>
    <section anchor="minSLO" title="Minimal Set of SLOs">
    <t>
      This document defines a minimal set of SLOs and later systems or standards could extend this set as per <xref target="otherSLO"/>. <!--For example, we included Guaranteed bandwidth which is the minimum requested bandwidth for the IETF network slice. The later standard might define other SLOs related to bandwidth if needed.-->
    </t>
<!-- WRT SLIs take a look at: https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/service-level-objectives/#indicators-o8seIAcZ - it has become the industry standard-->
    <t>
      SLOs can be categorized in to 'Directly Measurable Objectives' or 'Indirectly Measurable Objectives'. Objectives such as 
        guaranteed minimum bandwidth, 
        guaranteed maximum latency, 
        maximum permissible delay variation,     
        maximum permissible packet loss rate, 
        and availability are 'Directly Measurable Objectives'. While 'Indirectly Measurable Objectives' include
        security, geographical restrictions, maximum occupancy level objectives. The later standard might define other SLOs as needed.
</t>
      
<t> Editor's Note TODO: replace Minimal set to most commonly used objectives to describe network behavior. Other directly or indirectly measurable objectives may be requested by that consumer of an IETF network slice. </t>
<t>
The definition of these objectives are as follows:

<list style="hanging">

  <t>Guaranteed Minimum Bandwidth
    <list style="hanging"> <t>Minimum guaranteed bandwidth between two endpoints at any time. The bandwidth is measured in data rate 
    units of bits per second and is measured unidirectionally.</t>
    </list></t>

  <t>Guaranteed Maximum Latency
    <list style="hanging"><t> Upper bound of network latency when transmitting between two endpoints. The latency is 
    measured  in terms of network characteristics (excluding application-level latency). <xref target="RFC2681" /> and <xref target="RFC7679" /> 
    discuss round trip times and one-way metrics, respectively.
  </t></list></t>

  <t>Maximum Permissible Delay Variation
    <list style="hanging"><t> Packet delay variation (PDV) as defined by <xref target="RFC3393"/>, s the
    difference in the one-way delay between sequential packets in a
    flow.  This SLO sets a maximum value PDV for packets between
    two endpoints.
  </t></list></t>

  <t>Maximum permissible packet loss rate
    <list style="hanging"><t> 
      The ratio of packets dropped to packets transmitted between two
        endpoints over a period of time. See <xref target="RFC7680" />
  </t></list></t>

  <t> Availability
          <list style="hanging"><t>  The ratio of uptime to the sum of uptime and downtime, where
       uptime is the time the IETF network slice is available in accordance with the SLOs associated with it.</t></list></t>

  <t>Security
    <list style="hanging">
      <t> 
       An IETF network slice consumer may request that the network
       applies encryption or other security techniques to traffic
      flowing between endpoints. </t>

      <t> Note that the use of security or the violation of this SLO is
        not directly observable by the IETF network slice consumer and
       cannot be measured as a quantifiable metric. </t>
       <t> Also note that the objective may include request for encryption (e.g., <xref target="RFC4303"/>) between the two endpoints explicitly to meet architecture recommendations as in <xref target="TS33.210"/> or for compliance with <xref target="HIPAA"/> and/or <xref target="PCI"/>. </t><!--Other security requests may be made as specified in [draft-ietf-i2nsf-capability].-->
       <t> Editor's Note: Please see more discussion on security in <xref target="security"/>.</t>
     </list>
  
  </t>
</list>

</t>
      
</section> 
 <section anchor="otherSLO" title="Other Objectives">
      <t> 
      Additional SLOs may be defined to provide additional description of
   the IETF network slice that a consumer requests. 
    </t>
      <t> 
  <!--Jeff's review - these characteristics are not requested by a client but provided by a client for cases when transport slice is "traffic aware", same goes for "occupancy" EVPN would care about number of MAC addresses while optical transport would not, let's phrase this para differently --> <!--  kiran: added traffice aware-->
      If the IETF network slice consumer service is traffic aware, other traffic specific characteristics may be valuable including  MTU, traffic-type (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet or
      unstructured), or a higher-level behavior to process traffic according to user-application (which may be realized using network functions). </t>

<t> Maximal occupancy for an IETF network slice should be provided. Since it carries traffic for multiple flows between the two endpoints, the objectives should also say if they are for 
      the entire connection, group of flows or on per flow basis. Maximal occupancy should specify the scale of the 
      flows (i.e. maximum number of flows to be admitted) and optionally a maximum number of countable resource  units, e.g IP or MAC addresses a slice might consume.
      </t>
      

</section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="nse" title="IETF Network Slice Endpoints">

    <t>
      As noted in Section 3, an IETF network slice describes connectivity between multiple endpoints across the underlying network.  These connectivity types are: point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, multipoint-to-point multipoint-to-point, or multipoint-to-multipoint.
    </t>

    <t> 
      <xref target="fig_nse"/> shows an IETF network slice along with its NSEs.
    </t>

    <t>  
      The characteristics of IETF network slice endpoints (NSEs) are as follows:

      <list style="symbols">
        <t> 
          The IETF network slice endpoints (NSEs) are conceptual points of connection to IETF network slice. As such, they serve as the IETF network slice ingress/egress points. 
        </t>
        <t>
          Each endpoint can be: a device, application or a network function. A non-exhaustive list of devices, applications or network functions might include but not limited to: routers, switches, firewalls, WAN, 4G/5G RAN nodes, 4G/5G Core nodes, application acceleration, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), server load balancers, NAT44 <xref target="RFC3022"/>, NAT64 <xref target="RFC6146"/>, HTTP header enrichment functions, and TCP optimizers.
        </t>
        <t>
          An NSE should be uniquely identified within an IETF network slice. There are following possible schemes of selecting the unique identifiers. All conventions are technology agnostic.
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              To use a consumer-defined format such as a unique name for each NSE. This allows the IETF network slice controller (NSC) to uniquely identify each NSE.
            </t>
            <t>
              To choose well-known attributes such as using IPv4/IPv6 addresses, encapsulation type (i.e., VLAN tag, MPLS Label etc.), interface/port numbers, etc or their combinations.
            </t>
             <t>
              In addition to the approaches above, a clear association to the consumer (i.e., a consumer ID) might also be needed for avoiding ambiguity since it is possible that some IETF network slice consumers use overlapping IP addresses and other attributes like VLAN tags, etc. 
            </t>           
          </list>
          </t>
         <t>
          The IETF network slice endpoints are provided to IETF network slice controller (NSC) by the consumer of an IETF network slice during the creation/modification of the IETF network slice and used during the IETF network slice life-cycle.
        </t>
        <t>
          During the realization of the IETF network slice, in addition to SLOs, all or subset of IETF NSE attributes will be utilized by IETF network slice controller (NSC) to find the optimal realization in the IETF network.
        </t>
        <t>
          Similarly to IETF network slices, the IETF network slice endpoints are logical entities that are mapped to services/tunnels/paths endpoints in IETF network slice during its initialization and realization.
        </t>
      </list>
    </t>
    <t>
      Note that the IETF network slice Endpoint (NSE) is different from access points (AP) defined in <xref target="RFC8453"/> as an AP is a logical identifier to identify the shared link between the consumer and the operator whereas the NSE is the ingress/egress to IETF network slice. Also, NSE is different from TE Link Termination Point (LTP) defined in  <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te-topo"/> as it is a conceptual point of connection of a TE node to one of the TE-links on a TE node whereas the NSE is technology-agnostics and represents ingress/egress to IETF network slice. The NSE is conceptually similar to the Termination Point (TP) defined in <xref target="RFC8345"/> but with different attributes and characteristics.

  <t> In contrast, horizontal IETF network slices enable the composition of multiple realized netowrk slices. Since IETF network slices
    are not necessarily a single  encapsulation tunnel and may traverse through different data planes, each realized IETF network slice will require
    a stitching, interworking or mapping function. These stitching functions can be viewed as a type of intermediate network function endpoints.
    For instance in <xref target="fig_HNS"/>, TS11 and TS12 are horizontal IETF network slices. If we assume that TS11 is an L2 tunnel and TS12 is an SRV6 based path, then a 'Service type EP' (not shown in the figure) is needed for translation.

      <t>
      <xref target="fig_Transport-NS"/> illustrates a case where an IETF network slice provides connectivity between a set of IEFT network slice endpoints (NSE) pairs 
      with specific SLOs (e.g. guaranteed minimum bandwidth of x bps and guaranteed delay of no more than y ms). The IETF network slice endpoints
      are mapped to the underlay IETF networks endpoints (EP). Also, the IETF network slice endpoints 
      on the same IETF network slice may belong to the same or different address spaces.
      </t>
<t>
   IETF Network slice structure fits into a broader concept of end-to-end network slices.   A network
   operator may be responsible for delivering services over a number of
   technologies (such as radio networks) and for providing specific and
   fine-grained services (such as CCTV feed or High definition realtime traffic data). That operator may
   need to combine slices of various networks to produce an end-to-end
   network service.  Each of these networks may include multiple
   physical or virtual nodes and may also provide network functions
   beyond simply carrying of technology-specific protocol data units.An end-to-end network slice 
   is defined by the 3GPP as a complete logical network that provides a service in its entirety with a
   specific assurance to the consumer <xref target="TS.23.501-3GPP" />.</t>

   <t> An end-to-end network slice may be composed from other network slices
   that include IETF network slices.  This composition may include the
   hierarchical (or recursive) use of underlying network slices and the
   sequential (or stitched) combination of slices of different networks.</t>

 <section anchor="realize" title="Realizing IETF Network Slice">
   <t>
    Realization of IETF network slices is out of scope of this document.  It is a mapping of the definition of the IETF network slice to the underlying infrastructure and is necessarily technology-specific and achieved by the NSC over the SBI. </t>

   <t> The realization can be achieved in a form of either physical or logical connectivity through VPNs (see, for example, <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn" />, a variety of tunneling technologies such as Segment Routing, MPLS, etc.  
   Accordingly, endpoints may be realized as physical or logical service or network functions.
 </t> 
 

 </section>
<section anchor="isolation" title="Isolation in IETF Network Slices">

<t>
  An IETF network slice consumer may request, that the IETF Network
  Slice delivered to them is isolated from any other network slices of
  services delivered to any other consumers.  It is expected that the
  changes to the other network slices of services do not have any
  negative impact on the delivery of the IETF network slice.  
</t>
<section anchor="isoslo" title="Isolation as a Service Requirement">
<t> 
  Isolation may be an important requirement of IETF network slices
  for some critical services.  A consumer may express this request as
  an SLO.
</t>
<t>
  This requirement can be met by simple conformance with other SLOs.
  For example, traffic congestion (interference from other services)
  might impact on the latency experienced by an IETF network slice.
  Thus, in this example, conformance to a latency SLO would be the
  primary requirement for delivery of the IETF network slice service,
  and isolation from other services might be only a means to that end.
</t>
<t>
  It should be noted that some aspects of isolation may be measurable
  by a consumer who have the information about the traffic on a number
  of IETF network slices or other services.
</t>

</section>

<section anchor="isoreal" title="Isolation in IETF Network Slice Realization">

 <t>Delivery of isolation is achieved in the realization of IETF network slices, 
    with existing, in-development, and potential new technologies in IETF. 
   It depends on how a network operator decides to operate their network and
   deliver services. </t>

<t>Isolation may be achieved in the underlying network by various forms
  of resource partitioning ranging from dedicated allocation of
  resources for a specific IETF network slice, to sharing or resources
  with safeguards.  For example, traffic separation between different
  IETF network slices may be achieved using VPN technologies, such as
  L3VPN, L2VPN, EVPN, etc.  Interference avoidance may be achieved by
  network capacity planning, allocating dedicated network resources,
  traffic policing or shaping, prioritizing in using shared network
  resources, etc.  Finally, service continuity may be ensured by
  reserving backup paths for critical traffic, dedicating specific
  network resources for a selected number of network slices, etc. 
</t>

<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
  <t> This document specifies terminology and has no direct effect on the security of implementations or deployments. In this section, a few of the security aspects are identified.
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>Conformance to security constraints:
            Specific security requests from consumer defined IETF network slices will be mapped to their realization in the unerlay networks. It will be required by underlay networks to have capabilities to conform to consumer's requests as some aspects of security may be expressed in SLOs.
            <!--As  mentioned in <xref target="realize" />, there is an underlying asumption that traffic presented to an IETF network slice will not be misdelivered to an endpoint that is not part of that IETF network slice.--> </t>

        <t>IETF network slice controller authentication:
          Unerlying networks need to be protected against the attacks from an adversary NSC as they can destablize overall network operations. It is particularly critical since an IETF network slice may span across different networks, therefore, IETF NSC should have strong authentication with each those networks. Futhermore, both SBI and NBI need to be secured.
         </t>
         <t>Specific isolation criteria:
          The nature of conformance to isolation requests means that it should not be possible to attack an IETF network slice service by varying the traffic on other services or slices carried by the same underlay network.  In general, isolation is expected to strengthen the IETF network slice security.
         </t>
         <t> Data Integrity of an IETF network slice: 
          A consumer wanting to secure their data and keep it private will be responsible for applying appropriate security measures to their traffic and not depending on the network operator that provides the IETF network slice. It is expected that for data integrity, a consumer is responsible for end-to-end encryption of its own traffic.</t>
