1.  Introduction

   A number of use cases benefit from network connections that provide
   assurance of a specific set of network resources.  In this document,
   as detailed in the subsequent sections, we refer to this connectivity

   and resource commitment as the IETF-network slice.  Services that
   might benefit from the network slices include but not limited to:

   o  5G services (e.g. eMBB, URLLC, mMTC)(See [TS.23.501-3GPP])

   o  Network wholesale services

   o  Network infrastructure sharing among operators

   o  NFV connectivity and Data Center Interconnect

   Editor's Note: TODO provide forward reference to use case section

   Since this assertion is unsubstantiated and expressed as a
   speculation it reads like marketing!  I suspect we don't need it or
   the list of bullets, but maybe you could insert forward references to
   the sections that describe the use cases and how a transport slice
   might be beneficial in those cases (those would be sections yet to be
   written).  If, as you seem to imply, the reason for this document is
   to describe a term for a concept that has value in certain
   deployments, I think it is incumbent on you to describe those cases.

   This document defines the concept of IETF network slices that provide
   connectivity with a specific commitment of network resources between
   a number of end points over a shared network infrastructure.  Since
   the term network slice is quite generic and cannot be described
   universally, the qualifying term 'IETF' is used to limit the scope of
   network slice with in the network technologies described and
   standardized by IETF.

1.1.  Rationale

   IETF network slices are created and managed within the scope of one
   or more underlying network technologies (e.g., IP, MPLS, optical).
   They are expected to enable a diverse set of applications that have
   different requirements to coexist on the same network infrastructure.

   IETF network slice is a well-defined structure of connectivity
   requirements and network resources associated with it.  IETF Network
   slices are defined such that they are independent of the underlying
   infrastructure connectivity.  This allows customer to describe its
   network resource requirements in a common format, independent of any
   underlying technologies.  The types of underlying networking
   technologies can be based on any combination of IP, Ethernet, MPLS,
   and optical technologies.  IETF Network slices also include
   specification of resources related to network functions required by
   customer applications.

   Traditionally, VPNs have focussed on segmentation, i.e., creation and
   management of the private networks.  They are bound to a specific
   traffic type and are technology specific.  In contrast, IETF network
   slices concern with the assurance of resources required from the
   network and provide a common user interface for describing those
   resources.  A service provider can use many aspects of the VPNs to
   build the IETF network slices over IETF technologies.

   IETF network slices relate to a more general topic of end-to-end
   network slicing.  It is not the goal of this document to define this
   broader concept, but in general, it is to identify the methodology to
   describe the logical (or abstract) partitioning of network resources
   with in the IETF scope associated with a service or an application.

   TODO: add normative reference to other document in ITU and 3GPP in
   framework

   Editor's Note: TODO add detailed description in later section on
   SLO/SLI/SLA. we can move definition from here and to better explain
   the concept

   The above terminology is described in greater detail in the remainder
   of this document.

3.  Definition and Scope of IETF Network Slice

   The definition of a network slice in IETF context is as follows:

   "An IETF network slice is a logical network topology connecting a
   number of endpoints with a set of shared or dedicated network
   resources, that are used to satisfy specific Service Level Objectives
   (SLOs)".

   The text below describes IETF network slices in more details.

   IETF Network slice specification is technology-agnostic, and the
   means for IETF network slice realization can be chosen depending on
   several factors such as: service requirements, specifications or
   capabilities of underlying infrastructure.  The structure and
   different characteristics of IETF network slices are described in the
   following sections.

   Term "Slice" refers to a set of characteristics that separate one
   type of user-traffic from other types.  IETF Network slice assumes
   that an underlying network is capable of changing the configurations
   of the network devices on demand, through in-band signaling or via
   controller(s) and fulfilling all or some of SLOs to all of the
   traffic in the slice or to specific flows.

4.  IETF Network Slice System Characteristics

   The following subsections describe the characteristics of IETF
   network slices.

4.1.  Service Level Objectives for IETF Network Slices

   An IETF network slice is defined in terms of several quantifiable
   characteristics or service level objectives (SLOs).  These objectives
   define a set of network resource parameters or values necessary to
   provide a service as requested for a given IETF network slice.  SLOs
   do not describe 'how' the IETF network slices will be implemented or
   realized in the underlying network layers.  Instead, they are defined
   in terms of dimensions of operations (time, capacity, etc.),
   availability and other attributes.  An IETF network slice can have
   one or more SLOs associated with it, all SLO's combined to form an



Rokui, et al.            Expires April 17, 2021                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft  draft-nsdt-ietf-network-slice-definition    October 2020


   SLA.  The SLO values are defined unidirectionally and for specific
   subsets of two or more endpoints (i.e. for a subset of connections in
   IETF network slice).

   The SLOs and values associated with them that are exposed to the user
   of an IETF network slice, are in the form of Service Level Indicators
   (SLIs).  If for example the range of latencies a network can provide
   is 50ms-100ms, then this would be the range of values the IETF
   network slice user should be able to request, it would be as low as
   50ms or as high as 100ms or anything in between.  The values of
   requested SLOs should always be in the range of values supported.
   The underlying networks must provide means to monitor and measure the
   performance of network slices against the SLOs requested and verify
   that they are being met.  Some SLOs can be measured directly through
   a collection of metrics and statistics from the network (commonly
   known as 'telemetry'), while others are deduced from measurable
   objectives and may require additional tools or mechanisms to measure
   their target values.

4.1.1.  Minimal Set of SLOs

   This document defines a minimal set of SLOs and later systems or
   standards could extend this set and define more SLOs.  For example,
   we included Guaranteed bandwidth which is the minimum requested
   bandwidth for the IETF network slice.  The later standard might
   define other SLOs related to bandwidth if needed.

   Accordingly, SLOs can be categorized in to 'Directly Measurable
   Objectives' or 'Indirectly Measurable Objectives' as follows:

   Some of the 'Directly Measurable Objectives' are:

   o  Guaranteed Minimum Bandwidth

   o  Guaranteed Maximum Latency

   o  Maximum permissible delay variation

   o  Maximum permissible packet loss rate

   o  Availability

   o  Other objectives could be specified

   Some of the 'Indirectly Measurable Objectives' are:

   o  Security




Rokui, et al.            Expires April 17, 2021                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft  draft-nsdt-ietf-network-slice-definition    October 2020


   o  others objectives such as geographical restrictions, maximum
      occupancy level, etc. could be specified

   The definition of these objectives are as follows:

   o  Guaranteed Minimum Bandwidth: Minimum guaranteed bandwidth between
      two endpoints at any time.  The bandwidth is measured in data rate
      units of bits per second and is measured unidirectionally.

   o  Guaranteed Maximum Latency: Upper bound of network latency when
      transmitting between two endpoints.  The latency is measured in
      terms of network characteristics (excluding application-level
      latency).  [RFC2681] and [RFC7679] discuss round trip times and
      one-way metrics, respectively.

   o  Maximum permissible delay variation: Packet delay variation (PDV)
      as defined by [RFC3393], is measured by the difference in the one-
      way delay between sequential packets in a flow.  Minimizing
      variations in the delay is important for real-time applications.

   o  Maximum permissible packet loss rate: is defined by the ratio of
      packets dropped to packets transmitted between two endpoints.  See
      [RFC7680]

   o  Availability: is defined as the ratio of uptime to
      total_time(uptime+downtime), where uptime is the time the IETF
      network slice is available in accordance with the SLOs associated
      with it.

   o  Security: This objective may request for encryption [RFC4303]
      between two end-points explicitly to meet architecture
      recommendations as in [TS33.210] or for compliance with [HIPAA]
      [PCI].  Other security requests may be made as specified in
      [draft-ietf-i2nsf-capability].

      *  Note: Security violations are not directly observable and
         cannot be measured as quantifiable metrics.  Still, the
         customer of the IETF network slice should be able to request
         certain criteria for compliance and identify exceptions and
         unexpected traffic.  For this purpose [i2nsf-nsf-monitoring-
         data-model] can be leveraged.

4.1.2.  Other Objectives

   Additional objectives, such as certain geographical restrictions or
   well defined domains that a slice may transit may be necessary.





Rokui, et al.            Expires April 17, 2021                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft  draft-nsdt-ietf-network-slice-definition    October 2020


   Optionally, when the customer is traffic aware, other traffic
   specific characteristics may be provided.  These include for example,
   MTU, traffic-type (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet or unstructured), or a
   higher-level behavior to process traffic according to user-
   application (which may be realized using network functions).

   Maximal occupancy for an IETF network slice should be provided.
   Since it carries traffic for multiple flows between the two
   endpoints, the objectives should also say if they are for the entire
   connection, group of flows or on per flow basis.  Maximal occupancy
   should specify the scale of the flows (i.e. maximum number of
   accommodatable flows) and optionally a maximum number of countable
   resource units, e.g IP or MAC addresses a slice might consume.

   With these objectives incorporated, a customer sees IETF network
   slice as a dedicated network for its exclusive use.  Achieving this
   may require explicit request for different types of isolation in
   provider networks as described in Section 6.

   Additional description of slice attributes is covered in a broader
   context of 'Generic Network Slice Template' in
   [I-D.contreras-teas-slice-nbi].

4.2.  IETF Network Slice Endpoints

   The IETF network slice endpoints are the conceptual entities that
   perform any required conversion, or adaptation, and forwarding of the
   user traffic.  The characteristics of the IETF network slice
   endpoints (NSE) are:

   o  They are conceptual points of connection of a network function,
      device or application to the IETF network slice

   o  They are identified in a request provided by the customer of IETF
      network slice (i.e.  higher level operation systems) during the
      creation of the IETF network slice

   o  They are associated with a device, application and/or network
      function nodes.  A non-exhaustive list of such nodes are routers,
      switches, firewalls, WAN, 4G/5G RAN nodes, 4G/5G Core nodes,
      application acceleration, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), server
      load balancers, NAT44 [RFC3022], NAT64 [RFC6146], HTTP header
      enrichment functions, and TCP optimizers

   o  A NSE is identified by its associated node (its IP address, name ,
      ID, etc.), a unique identifier and/or a unique name and other
      data.  A non-exhaustive list of other data includes IP address (v4




Rokui, et al.            Expires April 17, 2021                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft  draft-nsdt-ietf-network-slice-definition    October 2020


      or v6), VLAN, port, connectivity type (P2P, P2MP, MP2MP).  TBD for
      more

   Note that the NSE is different from access points (AP) defined in
   [RFC8453] as an AP is a logical identifier to identify the shared
   link between the customer and the operator where as NSE is an
   identifier of an endpoint.  Also NSE is different from TE Link
   Termination Point (LTP) defined in [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te-topo] as it
   is a conceptual point of connection of a TE node to one of the TE
   links on a TE node.

   The NSE is similar to the Termination Point (TP) defined in [RFC8345]
   and can contain more attributes.  NSE could be modeled by augmenting
   the TP model.

   There is another type of the endpoints called "IETF Network Slice
   Realization endpoints (NSREs)".  These endpoints are allocated and
   assigned by the network controller during the realization of an IETF
   network slice and are technology-specific, i.e. they depend on the
   network technology used during the IETF network slice realization.
   They are identified by a node and some associated data.  A non-
   exhaustive list of nodes containing NSREs are routers, switches, PON
   nodes, Wireless nodes and Optical devices.

   Figure 1 shows an example of an IETF network slice and its
   realization between multiple NSEs and NSREs.

                               between NSREs

4.2.1.  IETF Network Slice Connectivity Types

   The IETF network slice connection types can be point to point (P2P),
   point to multipoint (P2MP), multi-point to point (MP2P), or multi-
   point to multi-point (MP2MP).  They will requested by the higher
   level operation system.

4.3.  Vertical Composition of IETF Network Slice

   IETF Network slice may follow a hierarchical relationship to provide
   a vertical structure to it.  This is used for composing multi-layer
   slices in which each layer provides an abstraction, as well as an
   independent monitoring, performance, control and management of the
   resources.  The vertical IETF Network slice characteristic could be
   used in 2 forms:

   o  The IETF Network slice itself where it represents a hierarchy of
      abstracted IETF network slices.  In this case, the realization
      will be done just once with a particular technology.  Thus, the
      lowest IETF network slice in the hierarchy that can not be
      decomposed further will be one to one mapping to its instance of
      the realized IETF network slice.

   o  Each layer (physical, datalink, or IP) has its own set of
      resources that can be provided to the upper layer as an IETF



Rokui, et al.            Expires April 17, 2021                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft  draft-nsdt-ietf-network-slice-definition    October 2020


      network slice.  Thus, IETF network slice at one layer is used by
      the layer above.  This type of multi-layer vertical IETF network
      slice associates resources at different layers.  For example, an
      IP IETF network slice would utilize one or more optical IETF
      network slice.  In this case, the realization will be done for a
      particular technology at that particular layer.  Thus, the lowest
      IETF network slice in this type of hierarchy that can not be
      decomposed further will be an instance of realized physical layer
      IETF network slice.

     Figure 2: IETF Network Slice Vertical and Horizontal Composition

   Figure 2 shows the netowrk slice hierarchy.  Slices TS11 and TS12 are
   composed together to form TS1 that is the top level netowrk slice
   definition, TS121 and TS122 collectively define TS12.  The SLO for
   bandwidth guarantee will be shared and latency guarantee will be
   split into latency in networks 2 and 3.  To emphasize the
   hierarchical structure, consider Network-2 and Network-3 are in the
   same administrative domain but use different netowrk technologies
   respectively.  Then instead of presenting 2 netowrk slices,
   Operator-z can expose only one netowrk slice TS12 abstracting the
   underlying netowrk technology details.

      Note: The specification to connect TS121 and TS122 are similar to
      those connecting TS12 and TS11.

4.4.  Horizontal Composition of IETF Network Slice

   In contrast, horizontal IETF network slices enable the composition of
   multiple realized netowrk slices.  Since IETF network slices are not
   necessarily a single encapsulation tunnel and may traverse through

   different data planes, each realized IETF network slice will require
   a stitching, interworking or mapping function.  These stitching
   functions can be viewed as a type of intermediate network function
   endpoints.  For instance in Figure 2, TS11 and TS12 are horizontal
   IETF network slices.  If we assume that TS11 is an L2 tunnel and TS12
   is an SRV6 based path, then a 'Service type EP' (not shown in the
   figure) is needed for translation.

   Author's notes: This service type EP is a new type of IETF network
   slice specific service function.  We may call it IETF network slice
   gateway.

5.  IETF Network Slice Structure

   An IETF network slice is a set of connections among various endpoints
   to form a logical network that meets the SLOs agreed upon.

   bps and guaranteed delay of less than y ms).  The endpoints may be

   distributed in the underlay networks, and an IETF network slice can
   be deployed across multiple network domains.  Also, the endpoints on
   the same IETF network slice may belong to the same address space.

   IETF Network slices involve both customer's and provider's views.  A
   customer 'describes' its requirements in terms of connectivity with
   specific SLOs.  Provider networks address those requirements through
   'IETF network slice realization' (its implementation) using provider
   network specific technologies.

   An IETF network slice is requested from an entity (such as an
   orchestrator or a system-wide controller) performing broader service
   or application specific functions.  The interface from such an entity
   should express the needed connectivity in a technology-agnostic way
   and donot need to recognize configurations based on the technologies
   (e.g. being more declarative than imperative).  The request to
   instantiate an IETF network slice is only represented with some
   indicators such as SLOs based on which the underlying technologies
   are selected and managed.

   Often, in other SDOs the term sub-slice or slice-subnet comes up.
   Some of those are mapped to transport network requirements in the
   form of an IETF network slice.  With in the scope of IETF network
   slices as described in this document, (w.r.t. the IP/MPLS based
   transport networks) there are no definitions for 'sub-slice' or
   'slice subnets'.  'IETF network slice' term universally represents
   SLO and connectivity requirements from those refered to as transport
   networks in other SDOs.

   Furthermore, the structure of IETF network slices may be layered
   vertically or composed horizontally, i.e. operationally, an IETF
   network slice maybe decomposed in two or more IETF network slices
   which are then independently realized and managed.  This is further
   described in Section 4.3.

5.1.  Stakeholders

   An IETF network slice and its realization involves the following
   stakeholders and it is relevant to define them for consistent
   terminology.

   Customer or User:  A customer is a requester of an IETF network
      slice.  Customers may request monitoring of associated resources
      or specific changes.  A customer may either directly manage its
      service by interfacing with the IETF network slice controller or
      indirectly through an orchestrator.

Internet-Draft  draft-nsdt-ietf-network-slice-definition    October 2020


   Orchestrator:  An orchestrator is an entity that composes different
      services, resource and network requirements.  It interfaces with
      the IETF network slice controllers.

   IETF Network Slice Controller (NSC):  It realizes an IETF network
      slice in the underlying network, maintains and monitors the run-
      time state of resources and topologies associated with it.  A
      well-defined interface is needed between different types of IETF
      network slice controllers and different types of orchestrators.
      An IETF network slice operator (or slice operator for short)
      manages one or more IETF network slices using the IETF Network
      Slice Controller(s).

   Network Controller:  is a form of network infrastructure controller
      that offers network resources to NSC to realize a particular
      network slice.  These may be existing network controllers
      associated with one or more specific technologies that may be
      adapted to the function of realizing IETF network slices in a
      network.

5.2.  IETF Network Slice Controller Interfaces

   The interworking and interoperability among the different
   stakeholders to provide common means of provisioning, operating and
   monitoring the IETF network slices is a mandatory requirement.  The
   following communication interfaces are identified (see Figure 4).

   TSC Northbound Interface (NBI):  The TSC Northbound Interface is an
      interface between a higher level operation system, e.g.  'E2E
      network slice orchestrator' and the 'E2E network slice
      controller'.  It is a technology agnostic interface.  Over this
      NBI, IETF network slice characteristics and other requirements can
      be communicated to TSC and the operational state of an IETF
      network slice may be requested.

   TSC Southbound Interface (SBI):  The TSC Southbound Interface is an
      interface between 'network slice controller (TSC)' and network
      controller(s).  These interfaces are technology-specific and
      utilize many of the network models.

5.3.  IETF Network Slice Realization

   Realization of an IETF Network Slice is a mapping of underlying
   infrastructure with its definition.  It is a technology specific
   entity that is created and maintained over its southbound interfaces.
   The Network controller(s) export the connectivity and resource
   mappings to the TSC.  The network controller abstracts the details of
   underlying resources from the TSC.

   The realization can be achieved in the form of either physical or
   logical connectivity through VPNs, a variety of tunneling
   technologies such as Segment Routing, SFC, etc.  Accordingly,
   endpoints may be realized as physical or logical service or network
   functions.

6.  Isolation in IETF Network Slices

6.1.  Traffic Isolation

   This section will describe the scope and use of term isolation.

6.2.  Dedicated Resources

   This section explains the scope and use of term dedicated resource in
   the context of IETF network slices.

7.  Relationship with End-to-End Network Slice

   An E2E network slice is a complete logical network that provides a
   service in its entirety with a specific assurance to the customer.
   An IETF network slice concerns with automation and assurance aspects
   only within the scope of IETF networks and is refered to as transport
   slice below, as described by other SDOs in the broader context of E2E
   network slice.  Consider Figure 5, where a network operator has an
   E2E network slice that traverses multiple technology-specific
   networks.  Each of these networks might use any number of
   technologies, including but not limited to IP, MPLS, Fiber-Optics
   (e.g.  WDM, DWDM), Passive Optical Networking (PON), Microwave, etc.

   Each of these networks includes multiple (physical or virtual) nodes
   and may also provide network functions beyond simply carrying of
   technology-specific protocol data units.  The types of nodes used in
   any of these networks may include:

   o  Packet/frame processing nodes (e.g., Routers, Switches)

   o  Application servers

   o  Service Functions(e.g., Firewall, Loadbalancer)

   o  Radio Access Network (RAN) components

   o  Mobile Core components

   o  Microwave transceivers

   o  Optical repeaters

   o  etc.

   Each network may support different technologies and an E2E network
   slice is a combination of these networks.  As an example:

   o  Network 1 might contain multiple 5G RAN nodes connected to a few
      Cell Site Gateways (CSG) routers.

   o  Network 2 might have one or more layer-3 routers and layer-2
      switches which may run on top of an optical network.

Internet-Draft  draft-nsdt-ietf-network-slice-definition    October 2020


   o  Network 3 might have a number of 5G RAN nodes connected to Passive
      Optical Network (PON) switches.

                        Figure 5: E2E network slice

   When operator-z creates a specific E2E network slice, it may create
   one or more of transport (IETF-network) slices and other slices
   (application logic or other system functions).

   An independent E2E logical network (called E2E network slice) is
   created for a service (e.g.  CCTV, autonomous driving, HD map, etc.)
   with a specific network SLOs, e.g. a secure connection with an E2E
   latency less than 5ms, from End User-x (EU-x) to End User-y (EU-y).
   EU-x maybe a 5G user equipment such as an infotainment unit in a car,
   CCTV, or a car for autonomous driving, etc. and EU-y in 5G is 5G
   application server, IMS, etc.

   In Figure 5, "E2E NS" is that logical network with requested SLO
   between EU-x to EU-y and is associated with a customer and a specific
   service type.
