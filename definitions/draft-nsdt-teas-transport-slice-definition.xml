   This document provides a definition of the term "IETF Network Slice" for
   use within the IETF and specifically as a reference for other IETF documents that
   describe or use aspects of network slices.
</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
    	<t>
		A number of use cases benefit from network connections that along with the connectivity provide assurance of meeting a specific set of 
        objectives wrt network resources use. In this document, as detailed in the subsequent sections, we refer to this connectivity and resource commitment 
        as an IETF network slice. Services that might benefit from the network slices include but not limited to:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>5G services (e.g. eMBB, URLLC, mMTC)(See <xref target="TS.23.501-3GPP"/>)</t>
          <t>Network wholesale services</t>
          <t>Network infrastructure sharing among operators</t>
          <t>NFV connectivity and Data Center Interconnect</t>
        </list>
       </t>

<t> The use cases are further described in <xref target="I-D.nsdt-teas-ns-framework"/>.
</t>

<t>
 This document defines the concept of IETF Network Slices that provide
 connectivity coupled with a set of specific commitments of network resources between a number
  of endpoints over a shared network infrastructure.  Since the term
  network slice is rather generic, the qualifying term 'IETF' is used in
  this document to limit the scope of network slice to network
  technologies described and standardized by the IETF. 
</t>

	<section title="Rationale">

  <t> IETF Network Slices are created and managed within the scope of one
 or more network technologies (e.g., IP, MPLS, optical).  They are
  intended to enable a diverse set of applications that have different
  requirements to coexist on the same network infrastructure.
</t>

<t>  An IETF Network Slice is a well-defined structure of connectivity
 requirements and associated network behaviors. IETF Network Slices
  are defined such that they are independent of the underlying
  infrastructure connectivity and technologies used.  
  This is to allow an IETF Network Slice consumer to describe their network connectivity and relevant objectives in a common format, independent of the
  underlying technologies used.
</t>
<t> IETF Network Slices may be combined hierarchically,
  so that a network slice may itself be sliced.  They may also be
  combined sequentially so that various different networks can each be
  sliced and the network slices placed into a sequence to provide an
  end-to-end service.  This form of sequential combination is utilized
  in some services such as in 3GPP's 5G network <xref target="TS.23.501-3GPP"/>.

 <section title="Definition and Scope of IETF Network Slice">

 <t>
 The definition of a network slice in IETF context is as follows:
</t>
<t>
 An IETF Network Slice is a logical network topology connecting a number of endpoints with a set of shared or dedicated network resources,
 that are used to satisfy specific Service Level Objectives (SLOs).
</t>

<!--
<t> The text below describes IETF network slices in more details.
</t>
-->
<t>
<!--Jeff's review June16: we are rephrasing definitions already made above -->
   <!-- kiran: A transport slice consists of a set of connections between multiple
   endpoints with a specified connectivity type and one or more SLOs associated with it.
SLOs are used to describe different characteristics of network resources associated with the service delivered and corresponding parameters necessary to 
realize the transport slice.-->
      </t>
 <t>
	IETF Network Slice specification is technology-agnostic, and the means for IETF network slice realization can be chosen depending on 
    several factors such as: service requirements, specifications or capabilities of underlying infrastructure. The structure and different 
    characteristics of IETF Network Slices are described in the following  sections.
 </t>
<t>
<!--
   The term "transport" in transport slice is derived from the definition of Transport Network in the section 1.3.1 of <xref target="RFC5921"/> : 
   A Transport Network provides transparent transmission of user traffic between attached client devices by establishing and maintaining 
   point-to-point or point-to-multipoint connections between such devices. 
-->

  Term "Slice" refers to a set of characteristics and behaviours that separate one type of 
   user-traffic from another. 
   IETF Network Slice assumes that an underlying network is capable of changing 
   the configurations of the network devices on demand, through in-band signaling or via controller(s) and fulfilling all or some of 
   SLOs to all of the traffic in the slice or to specific flows.
       </t>
  
      </section>

    <section anchor="TS-Char" title="IETF Network Slice System Characteristics">

      <t>
			The following subsections describe the characteristics of IETF network slices.
		</t>

        <section title="Objectives for IETF Network Slices">
        <t>
			An IETF Network Slice is defined in terms of several quantifiable characteristics or service level objectives (SLOs). SLOs along with terms Service Level Indicator (SLI) and Service Level Agreement (SLA) are used to define the performance of a service at different levels. 
</t>

<t>A Service Level Indicator (SLI) is a quantifiable measure of an
  aspect of the performance of a network.  For example, it may be a
   measure of throughput in bits per second, or it may be a measure of
   latency in milliseconds.
</t>
<t>
   A Service Level Objective (SLO) is a target value or range for the
   measurements returned by observation of an SLI.  For example, an SLO
   may be expressed as "SLI &lt;= target", or "lower bound &lt;= SLI &lt;= upper
   bound".  A network slice is expressed in terms of the set of SLOs
   that are to be delivered for the different connections between
   endpoints.
</t>
<t>
   A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is an explicit or implicit contract
   between the consumer of an IETF Network Slice and the provider of
   the slice.  The SLA is expressed in terms of a set of SLOs and may
   include commercial terms as well as the consequences of missing/violating the
   SLOs they contain.
</t>
   
 <t>
   Additional descriptions of IETF network slice attributes is covered
   in <xref target="I-D.contreras-teas-slice-nbi"/>.
 </t>

<section anchor="SLO" title=" Service Level Objectives">

<t>
  SLOs define a set of network attributes and characteristics that describe an IETF network
  slice.  SLOs do not describe 'how' the IETF network slices are
  implemented or realized in the underlying network layers.  Instead,
  they are defined in terms of dimensions of operation (time, capacity,
  etc.), availability, and other attributes.  An IETF network slice can
  have one or more SLOs associated with it.  The SLOs are combined in
  an SLA.  The SLOs are defined for sets of two or more endpoints and
  apply to specific directions of traffic flow.  That is, they apply to
  specific source endpoints and specific connections between endpoints
  within the set of endpoints and connections in the network slice.
</t>
</section>
    <section anchor="minSLO" title="Minimal Set of SLOs">
    <t>
      This document defines a minimal set of SLOs and later systems or standards could extend this set as per <xref target="otherSLO"/>. <!--For example, we included Guaranteed bandwidth which is the minimum requested bandwidth for the IETF network slice. The later standard might define other SLOs related to bandwidth if needed.-->
    </t>
<!-- WRT SLIs take a look at: https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/service-level-objectives/#indicators-o8seIAcZ - it has become the industry standard-->
    <t>
      SLOs can be categorized in to 'Directly Measurable Objectives' or 'Indirectly Measurable Objectives'. Objectives such as 
        guaranteed minimum bandwidth, 
        guaranteed maximum latency, 
        maximum permissible delay variation,     
		    maximum permissible packet loss rate, 
        and availability are 'Directly Measurable Objectives'. While 'Indirectly Measurable Objectives' include
        security, geographical restrictions, maximum occupancy level objectives. The later standard might define other SLOs as needed.
</t>
      
<t> Editor's Note TODO: Minimal set describes most commonly used objectives to describe network behavior. Other directly or indirectly measurable objectives may be requested by that customer of an IETF network slice. </t>
<t>
The definition of these objectives are as follows:

<list style="hanging">

  <t>Guaranteed Minimum Bandwidth
    <list style="hanging"> <t>Minimum guaranteed bandwidth between two endpoints at any time. The bandwidth is measured in data rate 
    units of bits per second and is measured unidirectionally.</t>
    </list></t>

  <t>Guaranteed Maximum Latency
    <list style="hanging"><t> Upper bound of network latency when transmitting between two endpoints. The latency is 
    measured  in terms of network characteristics (excluding application-level latency). <xref target="RFC2681" /> and <xref target="RFC7679" /> 
    discuss round trip times and one-way metrics, respectively.
  </t></list></t>

  <t>Maximum Permissible Delay Variation
    <list style="hanging"><t> Packet delay variation (PDV) as defined by <xref target="RFC3393"/>, s the
    difference in the one-way delay between sequential packets in a
    flow.  This SLO sets a maximum value PDV for packets between
    two endpoints.
  </t></list></t>

  <t>Maximum permissible packet loss rate
    <list style="hanging"><t> 
      The ratio of packets dropped to packets transmitted between two
        endpoints over a period of time. See <xref target="RFC7680" />
  </t></list></t>

  <t> Availability
          <list style="hanging"><t>  The ratio of uptime to the sum of uptime and downtime, where
       uptime is the time the IETF network slice is available in accordance with the SLOs associated with it.</t></list></t>

	<t>Security
    <list style="hanging">
      <t> 
       An IETF Network Slice consumer may request that the network
       applies encryption or other security techniques to traffic
      flowing between endpoints. </t>

      <t> Note that the use of security or the violation of this SLO is
        not directly observable by the IETF Network Slice consumer and
       cannot be measured as a quantifiable metric. </t>
       <t> Also note that the objective may include request for encryption (e.g., <xref target="RFC4303"/>) between the two endpoints explicitly to meet architecture recommendations as in <xref target="TS33.210"/> or for compliance with <xref target="HIPAA"/> and/or <xref target="PCI"/>. </t><!--Other security requests may be made as specified in [draft-ietf-i2nsf-capability].-->
       <t> Editor's Note: Please see more discussion on security in <xref target="security"/>.</t>
     </list>
  
  </t>
</list>

</t>
      
</section> 
 <section anchor="otherSLO" title="Other Objectives">
      <t> 
      Additional SLOs may be defined to provide additional description of
   the IETF network slice that a consumer requests. 
    </t>
      <t> 
  <!--Jeff's review - these characteristics are not requested by a client but provided by a client for cases when transport slice is "traffic aware", same goes for "occupancy" EVPN would care about number of MAC addresses while optical transport would not, let's phrase this para differently --> <!--  kiran: added traffice aware-->
      If the IETF Network Slice consumer service is traffic aware, other traffic specific characteristics may be valuable including  MTU, traffic-type (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet or
      unstructured), or a higher-level behavior to process traffic according to user-application (which may be realized using network functions). </t>

<t> Maximal occupancy for an IETF network slice should be provided. Since it carries traffic for multiple flows between the two endpoints, the objectives should also say if they are for 
      the entire connection, group of flows or on per flow basis. Maximal occupancy should specify the scale of the 
      flows (i.e. maximum number of flows to be admitted) and optionally a maximum number of countable resource  units, e.g IP or MAC addresses a slice might consume.
      </t>
		  

</section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="tse" title="IETF Network Slice Endpoints">

    <t>
      As noted in Section 3, an IETF network slice describes connectivity between endpoints across the underlying network.  This connectivity may be be point-to-point, point-to-multipoint (P2MP), multipoint-to- point, or multipoint-to-multipoint. 
    </t>
    <t>  
      The characteristics of IETF network slice endpoints (NSEs) are as follows.
    
    
    <list style="symbols">
    <t> 
      They are conceptual points of connection of a customer network, network function, device, or application to the IETF network slice.  This might include routers, switches, firewalls, WAN, 4G/5G RAN nodes, 
      4G/5G Core nodes, application acceleration, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), server load balancers, NAT44 <xref target="RFC3022"/>, NAT64 <xref target="RFC6146"/>, HTTP header enrichment functions, and TCP optimizers.
    </t>
    <t> 
      They are identified in a request provided by the consumer of an IETF Network Slice when the IETF Network Slice is requested.
    </t>
    <t> 
      An NSE is identified a unique identifier and/or a unique name and other data.  A non-exhaustive list of other data includes IPv4 or
     IPv6 address, VLAN tag, port number, connectivity type (P2P, P2MP, MP2MP).
    </t>
    </list>
    </t>
       
    <t> 
      Note that the NSE is different from access points (AP) defined in <xref target="RFC8453"/> as an AP is a logical identifier to identify the shared link between the customer and the operator where as NSE is an identifier of an endpoint. 
      Also NSE is different from TE Link Termination Point (LTP) defined in  <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te-topo"/> as it is a conceptual point of connection of a TE node to one of the TE links on a TE node.</t>
    <t> 
      The NSE is similar to the Termination Point (TP) defined in <xref target="RFC8345"/> and can contain more attributes. NSE could be modeled by augmenting the TP model.
    </t>
<!--
       <t>Note that TSE concept is similar to the Link Termination Point (LTP) defined in  <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te-topo"/> and access points (AP) defined in [RFC8453] with an important difference. 
       The main difference between them is that both LTP and AP are about a specific set of implementations based on characteristics of the TE network while NSE is an effort to hide the details of the underlying realizaion. </t>

       <t>AP is a common identifier for the TE link (See section 2.1 RFC8453) and LTP is a conceptual point of connection of a TE node to one of the TE links, terminated by the TE node (see section 3.5  <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te-topo"/>) 
       whereas NSE is the connection point to the transports slice. Note that it might be that the trasport slice is realized in a non-TE network and NSE might not be assocaiate to TE network. 
       The TE characteristic of the network might be taken into consideration during the realization of a transport slice in a TE network.</t>
-->
       <t>There is another type of the endpoints called "IETF Network Slice Realization Endpoints (NSREs)". These endpoints are allocated and assigned by the network controller during the realization of an IETF Network Slice and are technology-specific, i.e. 
       they depend on the network technology used during the IETF Network Slice realization. 
       The identification of NSREs forms part of the realization of the IETF Network Slice and is implementation and deployment specific.</t>


       <t> <xref target="fig_tse_tsre"/> shows an example of an IETF Network Slice and its realization between multiple NSEs and NSREs.</t>

      <xref target="fig_Transport-NS"/> illustrates a case where an IETF Network Slice provides connectivity between a set of endpoints pairs 
      with specific characteristics for each SLO (e.g. guaranteed minimum bandwidth of x bps and guaranteed delay of no more than y ms). The endpoints 
      may be distributed in the underlay networks, and an IETF Network Slice can be deployed across multiple network domains. Also, the endpoints 
      on the same IETF Network Slice may belong to the same or different address spaces.
      </t>
<t>
   IETF Network slice structure fits into a broader concept of end-to-end network slices.   A network
   operator may be responsible for delivering services over a number of
   technologies (such as radio networks) and for providing specific and
   fine-grained services (such as CCTV feed or High definition realtime traffic data). That operator may
   need to combine slices of various networks to produce an end-to-end
   network service.  Each of these networks may include multiple
   physical or virtual nodes and may also provide network functions
   beyond simply carrying of technology-specific protocol data units.An end-to-end network slice 
   is defined by the 3GPP as a complete logical network that provides a service in its entirety with a
   specific assurance to the customer <xref target="TS.23.501-3GPP" />.</t>

   <t> An end-to-end network slice may be composed from other network slices
   that include IETF Network Slices.  This composition may include the
   hierarchical (or recursive) use of underlying network slices and the
   sequential (or stitched) combination of slices of different networks.</t>
      
      <!-- Jeff's comments - can't parse it, please rephrase it-->
      <!-- Kiran: been asked to move this to framework
      <t>
      IETF Network slices involve both customer's and provider's views. 
      A customer 'describes' its requirements in terms of connectivity  with specific SLOs.
      Provider networks address those requirements through 'IETF network slice realization' (its implementation) using provider network specific technologies.


      The "Transport Slices" provides various connections with various SLOs between various endpoints whereas the transport slice realization 
      addresses its implementation using various technologies.
      In short, the transport slice involves both its definition and its realization; the transport slice definiton addresses the set of connectivities 
      with required SLOs whereas the transport slice realization addresses how this transport slice is deployed in the network for certain network 
      technologies.

      <!-- Jeff's comments - "higher" reads really wierd, the direction is South->North (not low->high), let's use the directions accoringly?
      
      <t> A transport slice is built based on a request from a higher level operation system. The interface to higher operations systems 
      should express the needed connectivity in a technology-agnostic way, and slice customers don't need to recognize concrete 
      configurations based on the technologies (e.g. being more declarative than imperative). The request to instantiate a transport slice is 
      represented with some indicators such as SLO, and technologies are selected and managed accordingly. 
      </t>

      Kiran: remove request <t> An IETF network slice is requested from an entity (such as an orchestrator or a system-wide controller) performing broader service or application specific functions. 

      The interface from such an entity should express the needed connectivity in a technology-agnostic way and  donot need to recognize configurations based on the technologies (e.g. being more declarative than imperative). 
      The request to instantiate an IETF network slice is 
      only represented with some indicators such as SLOs based on which the underlying technologies are selected and managed. 
      </t>

      <t>
	Entities above the TSC may be managing a broader construct called network slices. Often, in other SDOs the term sub-slice or slice-subnet comes up. Some of those are mapped to transport network requirements in the form of an IETF network slice.

  With in the scope of IETF network slices as described in this document, (w.r.t. the IP/MPLS based
	transport networks) there are no definitions for 'sub-slice' or 'slice subnets'. 'IETF network slice' term universally represents SLO and connectivity requirements from those refered to as transport networks in other SDOs.-->

 <section anchor="isolation" title="Isolation in IETF Network Slices">
<t> Editor's note: This content is a work in progress. The section on isolation is too descriptive.</t>
<t>
   An IETF Network Slice consumer may request, that the IETF Network Slice
   delivered to them is isolated from any other network slices of
   services delivered to any other customers.  It is expected that the changes to the other network slices 
   of services do not have any negative impact on the delivery of the IETF Network Slice. In a more general sense, isolation can be classified in the following ways:
   <list style="hanging">
	<t hangText="Traffic Separation:"> Traffic of one network slice should not be subjected to policies and forwarding rules of other network slices. </t>
	<t hangText="Interference Avoidance:"> Changes in other network slices should not impact to the SLOs of the network slice. Here the changes in other network slice may include the changes in connectivity, traffic volume, traffic pattern, etc.</t>
	<t hangText="Service Assurance:"> In case service degradation is unacceptable due to unpredictable network situations producing service degradation (e.g., major congestion events, etc.), explicit reservation of resources in the network maybe requested for a reduces set IETF network slices.</t>
</list>
</t>
<!--
<t> 
  
  This requirement may be met by simple conformance with other SLOs. For example, traffic congestion (interference from other services) might impact on the latency experienced by an IETF network slice. 
  Thus, conformance to a latency SLO would be the primary requirement for delivery of the IETF network slice service, and isolation from other services might be only a means to that end.
</t>

<t> Nevertheless, "isolation" remains a useful shorthand to describe the
   desire that an IETF network slice should not be impacted by any other
   network slice or service supported by the underlying network.  The
   concept may also be useful for achieving independence against failure
   between a pair of IETF network slices (used, for example, for backup
   connectivity). </t>

   <t> Other meanings of "isolation" such as "do not deliver traffic from
   this IETF network slice to an endpoint that is not part of this IETF
   network slice" should be taken for granted by the definition and
   realization of any IETF network slice. </t>
-->
<section anchor="isoslo" title="Isolation as a Service Requirement">

<!--
   <t>As described above, the concept of "isolation" may be presented as an
   SLO.  It may be unqualified as "keep this IETF network slice free
   from effects caused by any other network slice or service," qualified
   as "keep a specific SLI free from effects caused by any other network
   slice or service," or tightly specified to the effects or
   vulnerabilities of another specific IETF network slice. </t>

   <t> It should be noted that some aspects of isolation may be measurable
   by a customer who can control the traffic on a number of IETF network
   slices or other services.</t>

<t>Isolation may be achieved in the underlying network by various forms of resource partitioning ranging from dedicated allocation of resources for a specific IETF network slice, to sharing or resources with safeguards.
For example, traffic separation between different IETF network slices may be achieved using VPN technologies, such as L3VPN, L2VPN, EVPN, etc. Interference avoidance may be achieved by network capacity planning, allocating dedicated network resources, traffic policing or shaping, prioritizing in using shared network resources, etc. Finally, service continuity may be ensured by reserving backup paths for critical traffic, dedicating specific network resources for a selected number of network slices, etc. </t>

<t> Editor's note: This 5G subsection should not be added to terminology. it does not add value to the definitions.</t>

<t>In the context of 5G network slice, "isolation level" is listed as one of the attributes which can be used to characterize the type of network slice [GSMA Generic Network Slice Template]. For 5G network slice, different types of isolation are considered, including physical and logical isolation. Physical isolation refers to different physical network entities, and logical isolation is further classified into virtual resource isolation, network function isolation and tenant/service isolation.

   An end-to-end network slice is defined by the 3GPP as a complete

   <t> Editor's Note: Need further improvement; work in progress.</t>
    <t>
    This document specifies terminology and has no direct effect on the security of implementations or deployments. </t>

  <t> 
    As noted in <xref target="minSLO" />, some aspects of security may be expressed in SLOs and so form part of the service delivered as an IETF network slice.  As further mentioned in Section 8, there is an underlying asumption that traffic presented to an IETF network slice will not be misdelivered to an endpoint that is not part of that IETF network slice. </t>

  <t> 
    Furthermore, the nature of conformance to SLOs means that it should not be possible to attack an IETF network slice service by varying the traffic on other services or slices carried by the same underlay network.  This concern can be strengthened by the stipulation of "isolation" as an SLO.</t>

  <t> Note, however, that a customer wanting to secure their data and keep it private will be responsible for applying appropriate security measures to their traffic and not depending on the network operator that provides the IETF network slice. </t>
