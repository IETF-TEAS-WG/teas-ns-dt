    <section title="Introduction">
	<!-- SH-28Jan:  modified the following text for  emphasizing  benefitial features of network slicing. -->
    	<t>
		A number of use cases benefit from establishing network connectivity providing transport and assurance of a specific set of 
        network resources. In this document, as detailed in subsequent sections, we refer to this connectivity and resource commitment 
        as transport slices. Services that might benefit from the transport slices include:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>5G services (e.g. eMBB, URLLC, mMTC)(See <xref target="TS.23.501-3GPP"/>)</t>
          <t>Network wholesale services</t>
          <t>Network infrastructure sharing among operators</t>
          <t>NFV connectivity and Data Center Interconnec</t>
         <!-- <t>VPNs with specific characteristics</t> -->
        </list>
       </t>
	   <t>
		  This document defines the concept of transport slices that provide connectivity with specific commitment of network resources 
          between a number of end points over a shared network infrastructure. 
        </t>

     <t> 
     Transport slices are created and managed within the scope of one or more underlying network technologies (e.g. IP, MPLS, optical). 
     These transport slices are expected to enable a diverse set of applications, that have different requirements on communication, to 
     coexist on the same network infrastructure. 
     </t>

	<t>
	Transport slices relate to a more general topic of network slicing. It is not the goal of this document to define this broader concept, 
    but in general, it is a methodology to describe the logical (or abstract) partitioning of network resources associated with a service or 
    an application. 
    </t>

	<section title="Rationale">
		<t>
        Transport slice is described as a construct that specifies connectivity requirements with an emphasis on assurance of those 
        requirements. Transport slices are unaware of any underlying infrastructure connectivity (hence, the term "transport"). The types of 
        underlying provider networks can be based on any combination of IP, Ethernet, MPLS and Optical technologies. 
        </t>

        <t> 
        Existing VPN (L2 or L3) network and particularly service models come close to satisfying similar requirements. The difference is that 
        a user of transport slice does not concern with the specific details related to the connectivity, such as what are the provider addresses, VRFs, or 
        what routing protocols to use, and so on. In cases where customers need more control over network technology aspects, direct use of 
        VPN technologies or service models will be more suitable. 
        </t>

        <t>
        Transport slices also include specification of resources related to network functions that are necessary for several customer 
        applications. Thus, the goal of transport slice is to serve as a generic SLO-assured connectivity construct over different kinds of 
        underlying infrastructures.

 <section title="Definition and Scope of Transport Slice">
		<!--<section title="Transport Slice Definition">
			 -->

 <t>
 The definition of a transport slice is as follows:
</t>
<t>
 "A transport slice is a logical network topology connecting a number of endpoints and a set of shared or dedicated network resources,
 which are used to satisfy specific Service Level Objectives (SLO)".
</t>

<t> The text below describes transport slices in more detail.
</t>
<t>
   A transport slice consists of a set of connections between multiple
   endpoints with a specified connectivity type and one or more SLOs associated with it.
SLOs are used to describe different characteristics of network resources associated with the service delivered and corresponding parameters necessary to 
realize the transport slice.
      </t>
 <t>
	Transport slice specification should be technology-agnostic, and the means for transport slice realization can be chosen depending on 
    several factors such as service requirements, specifications or capabilities of underlying infrastructure. The structure and different 
    characteristics of transport slices are described in the following  sections.
 </t>
<t>
   The term "transport" in transport slice is derived from the definition of Transport Network in the section 1.3.1 of <xref target="RFC5921"/> : 
   A Transport Network provides transparent transmission of user traffic between attached client devices by establishing and maintaining 
   point-to-point or point-to-multipoint connections between such devices. "Slice" refers to the characteristics that separate one type of 
   user-traffic from other types of traffic. Thus, transport slice assumes that an underlying transport network has capability to change 
   the configurations of the network nodes on demand, through in-band signalling or via controller(s) and to provide transport transmissions with fulfilling all or some of 
   SLOs to specific flows.
       </t>
  
      </section>

    <section anchor="TS-Char" title="Transport Slice System Characteristics">

      <t>
			The following subsections describe the characteristics needed for support of transport slices.
		</t>

        <section title="Service Level Objectives for Transport Slices">
        <t>
			A transport slice is defined in terms of several quantifiable characteristics or service-level objectives (SLOs). These objectives define a set of
			network resource parameters or values necessary to provide a service as requested for a given transport slice. SLOs will not describe
			'how' will trasnport slices will be implemented or realized in the underlying networks. They will instead be defined in terms of dimensions of operations (time, capacity,...), availability and other attributes.
      A transport slice can have one or more SLOs associated with it. 
      The SLO values can be defined in each direction and for specific subsets of two or more endpoints (i.e. for a subset of connections in transport slice).
    </t>
    <t>      
    The values of requested SLOs should be clearly specified. It should be possible to monitor and measure the performance of transport 
    slices against the requested SLOs and verify that they are being met. Some SLOs can be measured directly through collection of metrics or statistics 
    from the network,while others are deduced from measurable objectives and may require additional tools or mechanisms to 
    measure their target values. Accordingly, SLOs can be categorized in to 'Directly Measurable Objectives' or 'Indirectly Measurable 
    Objectives' as follows:

    </t>      
    <t>      
      Some of the 'Directly Measurable Objectives' are: Objectives': 
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Guaranteed Bandwidth</t>
        <t>Guaranteed Maximum Latency</t>
        <t>Maximum permissible delay variation</t>
        <t>Availability</t>
		    <t>Maximum permissible packet loss rate</t>
        <t>NF resources</t>
        <t>Other objectives could be specified</t>
      </list>

      Some of the 'Indirectly Measurable Objectives' are: 
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Shared fate resources</t>
        <t>Security</t>
        <t>others objectives such as geographical restrictions, maximum occupancy level, etc. could be specified</t>
      </list>

      The definiton of the these objectives are as follows:

      <list style="symbols">

        <t>Guaranteed minimum Bandwidth: Minimum requested bandwidth between two endpoints. The bandwidth is measured in data rate 
        units of bits per second and can be requested unidirectionally.</t>

        <t>Guaranteed maximum Latency: Maximum permissible network delay when transmitting between two endpoints. The latency is 
        measured  in terms of network characteristics (excluding application-level latency). <xref target="RFC2681" /> and <xref target="RFC7679" /> 
        discuss round trip times and one-way metrics, respectively.</t>

        <t>Maximum permissible delay variation: Packet delay variation (PDV) as defined by <xref target="RFC3393"/>, is measured by 
        the difference in the one-way delay between sequential packets in a flow. Minimizing variations in the delay are important for real-time 
        applications.</t>

        <t>Maximum permissible packet loss rate: is defined by
          the ratio of packets dropped to packets transmitted between two endpoints. See <xref target="RFC7680" /></t>

        <t>NF resources: These resources may be optionally used in order to provide specification for virtual network functions which are part of 
        the transport slice endpoints. See <xref target="NFVGST" />.</t>

        <t> Availability: is defined as the ratio of uptime to total_time(uptime+downtime).</t>


	<t>Security: This objective may request for encryption [RFC4303] between two end-points explicitly to meet architecture recommendations as in [TS33.210] or for compliance [HIPAA][PCI]. Other security requests can be made as specified in [I2NSF] 
      <list style="">
	<t> Note: Security violations are difficult to observe and cannot be measured as quantifiable metric. Still, the user of transport slice should be able to request certain criteria for compliance and be able to identify exceptions and unexpected traffic. For this purpose [i2nsf-nsf-monitoring-data-model-06] can be leveraged. </t> 
    </list>
</t>
    </list>

<!--The framework <xref target="I-D.nsdt-teas-ns-framework"/> may further specify mechanisms for the performance, assurance and monitoring of these objectives. -->
      </t>
      
      <t> 
      Additional objectives may be necessary, such as specifying specific characteristics/ well defined paths or domains that a slice may transit. A transport slice carries 
      multiple flows between the 2 endpoints, therefore objectives should also say if they are aggregates or on per flow basis and in such case to
      be specific enough for the system to be able to identify these specifics (subset of flows).
    </t>
      <t> 
      Optionally, other traffic characteristics may be requested. These include for example MTU, traffic type (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet, 
      unstructured.  A transport slice carries multiple flows between the 2 endpoints, therefore objectives should also say if they are for 
      the entire connection, group of flows or on per flow basis. Flow characteristics of a transport slice should specify the scale of the 
      flows (i.e. maximum number of accommodatable flows) and optionally a maximum number of countable rosurce  units, e.g IP or MAC addresses a slice might consume.
      </t>

        <section anchor="Vertical-Concept" title="Vertical Transport Slice (tbd)">
        <!-- [Reza comment: we need to talk about thissssss]"-->
        <t>
			Transport slice may follow a hierarchical relationship that would provide a vertical structure to it. This is used
			for  building multi-layer slices in which each layer provides an abstraction, as well as an independent
			monitoring, performance, control and management of the resources.
			The vertical transport slice characteristic maybe used in 2 forms:
			<list style="symbols">
			  <t> The Transport slice itself where it represents a hierarchy of abstracted transport slices. In this case, realization
				  will be done just once with a particular technology.  Thus, the lowest transport slice in the hierarchy that
				  can not be decomposed further will be one to one mapping to its instance of realized transport slice.</t>
			  <t> Each layer (physical, datalink, or IP) has its own set of resources that  can be provided to the upper layer as
				  a transport slice. Thus, transport slice at one layer is used by the layer above. This type of
				  multi-layer vertical
				 transport slice associates resources at different layers. For example, an IP transport slice
				 would utilize one or more optical transport slice.  In this case, realization
				will be done for  a particular technology at that particular layer. Thus, the lowest transport slice in this type of hierarchy that
				can not be decomposed further will be an instance of realized physical layer transport slice.</t>

      <section title="Horizontal Composition of Transport slice">
	<t> In contrast, horizontal transport slices enable the composition of multiple realized transport slices. Since transport slices
		are not necessarily a single  encapsulation tunnel and may traverse through different data planes, each realized transport slice will require
		a stitching, interworking or mapping function. These stitching functions can be viewed as a type of intermediate network function endpoints.
		For instance in <xref target="fig_HNS"/>, TS11 and TS12 are horizontal transport slices. If we assume that TS11 is an L2 tunnel and TS12 is an SRV6 based path, then a 'Service type EP' (not shown in the figure) is needed for translation.

	Author's notes: This  service type EP is  a new type of transport slice specific service function. We may call it transport slice

       <t>
        A transport slice is a set of connections among various endpoints to form a logical network. The goal is to achieve specific SLO for a customer
        as shown in  <xref target="fig_Transport-NS"/>. The endpoints may be user equipment, any physical or virtual network functions (PNF/VNF),
        or any network service for that matter. Similarly,  the connections may be virtual or physical links of any type of technology.

      <t>
      <xref target="fig_Transport-NS"/> illustrates a case where a transport slice provides connectivity between a set of endpoints pairs 
      with specific characteristics for SLO (e.g. gauranteed minimum bandwidth of x bps and gauranteed delay of less than y ms). The endpoints 
      may be distributed in the underlay networks, and a transport slice can be deployed across multiple network domains. Also, the endpoints 
      on the same transport slice may belong to the same address space.
      </t>

      <t>
      The "Transport Slices" provides various connections with certain SLO between various endpoints whereas the transport slice realization 
      addresses its implementation using various technologies.
      In short, the transport slice involves both its definition and its realization; the transport slice definiton addresses the set of connectivities 
      with required SLOs whereas the transport slice realization addresses how this transport slice is depolyed in the network for certain network 
      technologies.
      </t>

			<!--
	<t> A "transport slice" addresses a set of technology-agnostic connections between various
		endpoints with certain SLOs.  The managing entity or operating stakeholder of a transport slice is
		called a Transport Slice Controller.
    </t>

   <t>
       Transport slice realization uses specific technologies in the operator's network.
       The realization may require allocating appropriate resources into one or more networks and a mapping to transport slice. The managing 
       entity realizing a transport slice is
		referred to as the network controller. 
        </t>
-->
      <t> A transport slice is built based on a request from a higher level operation system. The interface to higher operations systems 
      should express the needed connectivity in a technology-agnostic way, and slice customers don't need to recognize concrete 
      configurations based on the technologies (e.g. being more declarative than imperative). The request to instantiate a transport slice is 
      represented with some indicators such as SLO, and technologies are selected and managed accordingly. 
      </t>

      <t>
	In the context of network slices, the term sub-slice or slice-subnet comes up
	in other standard organizations, however, w.r.t. the IP/MPLS based
	transport networks these terms are all equivalent.
       </t>

	<t>Furthermore, the structure of transport slices may be layered vertically or composed horizontally, i.e. operationally,
			 a transport slice maybe decomposed in two or more transport slices which are then
			independently realized and managed. This is further described in <xref target="Vertical-Concept"/>.</t>

 <section title="Transport slice Realization">
	 <t>
	 Realization of a Transport Slice is a mapping of underlying infrastructure with its definition. It is technology specific 
     entity that is created and maintained over southbound interfaces. The Network controller(s) export the connectivity and 
     resource mappings to the TSC. The network controller abstracts the details of underlying resources from the TSC.
 </t> 
 
 <t>
	 The realization may be achieved in the form of either physical or logical connectivity through VPNs, a variety of tunneling 
     technologies such as segment routing, SFC, etc. Accordingly, endpoints may be realized as physical or logical service or network functions.
 </t>

 </section>
  </section>
    <section title="Relationship with End-to-End Network Slicing">
      <t>
        An end-to-end (E2E) network slice is a complete logical network that provides a service in its entirety with a specific
        assurance to the customer. A transport slice concerns with those assurance aspects only within the transport networks.
        Consider <xref target="fig_E2E-NS"/>,
        where a network operator has an E2E network slice that traverses multiple technology-specific networks. Each of these networks might use
        any number of technologies, including but not limited to IP, MPLS, Fiber-Optics (e.g. WDM, DWDM), Passive Optical Networking (PON), Microwave, etc.
      </t>
      <t>
       Each of these networks includes multiple (physical or virtual) nodes and may also provide network functions beyond simply carrying of technology-specific
       protocol data units. The types of nodes used in any of these networks may include:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Packet/frame processing nodes (e.g., Routers, Switches)</t>
        <t>Application servers</t>
        <t>Service Functions(e.g., Firewall, Loadbalancer)</t>
        <t>Radio Access Network (RAN) components</t>
        <t>Mobile Core components</t>
        <t>Microwave transceivers</t>
        <t>Optical repeaters</t>
        <t>etc.</t></list>
      </t>
      <t>
    Each network may support different technologies and an E2E network slice is a combination of these networks. As an example:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Network 1 might contain multiple 5G RAN nodes connected to a few Cell Site Gateways (CSG) routers. </t>
        <t>Network 2 might have one or more layer-3 routers and layer-2 switches which may run on top of an optical network.</t>
        <t>Network 3 might have a number of 5G RAN nodes connected to Passive Optical Network (PON) switches.</t>

      <t>
      When an operator-z creates a specific E2E network slice, it may create
      one or more of transport slices and other slices (application logic or other system functions).
      </t>

      <t>
     An independent E2E logical network (called E2E network slice) is created for a service (e.g. CCTV, autonomous driving, HD map, etc.) with a specific network SLO requirement
		e.g. a secure connection with an E2E latency less than 5ms, from End User-x (EU-x) to End User-y (EU-y). EU-x maybe a 5G user equipment such as an infotainment unit in a 
        car, CCTV, or a car for autonomous driving, etc. and
    EU-y in 5G is 5G application server, IMS, etc.
      </t>
      <t>
    In <xref target="fig_E2E-NS"/>,  "E2E NS"  is that logical
    network with requested SLO between EU-x to EU-y and   is
    associated with a customer and a specific service type.
      </t>

	  <!--
      <t>
    As a concrete example, a customer "City of NY" would like to connect all its CCTV cameras for the entire city to one or more locations for viewing or collection. To this end, it requests local carrier - 'operator-z' in NY to create a new E2E network slice with a bandwidth no-less-than 10Mbps from each CCTV coverage area. In this case, a single E2E network slice will be created by the operator-z for the customer "City of NY", service type of CCTV and requested bandwidth connecting all the CCTV camera zones to one or more control-centers for the collection of video data.
      </t>
      <t>
    It may also be possible that more than one customer and/or service types are associated with an E2E network slice.

    For instance, an E2E network slice is associated with not only to service type CCTV
    but another service "Public Safety", i.e. NS ID 10 is used for two services for "City of NY".

		aspects of isolation, first the resolution of isolation of an objective (as described above) and second, the dedicated use or 
        a hard-separation perspective of the resource.
	</t>
	<t>
	Providing a hard resolution of guarantee for the characteristics of a
	transport slice means that the behavior and performance of other transport slices
   should not impact that slice, even if they run over the same underlying
   infrastructure or use logically shared network resources.
   </t>
   <t>
	  In the context of soft resolution of guarantees, since the transport slices are
	  logically partitioned over the
      shared resources, a certain degree of commitment to the guarantee
      is expected even when it is not hard.  When the shared resource
      pools begin to become saturated, SLO violations can happen,
      however, impacting only the performance or operation of service
      associated with the transport slice.
   </t>
   <t>
   This degree of isolation can be derived from availability
   characteristics requested, such as whether a hard or soft guarantee was
   requested. Requesting a hard guarantee may commit more resources
   than would be required for a softer limit.
   </t>
   <t> 
   In addition, resource isolation
	may be applied to ensure dedicated access to a particular node, for instance. In such
	requests a dedicated allocation to a link, node and/or other resources to create a
	transport slice for a particular service. For example, a mission-critical service
	may ask for a dedicated router and/or a link or port for complete isolation from other
	services.
   </t>
   <t>
   When realizing a transport slice, a network controller should be
   responsible for allocating and providing resources according to the specified
   objectives.
   </t>
	<t> SLO violations can occur for two reasons and corresponding statements apply
	<list style="symbols">
	<t>
      Shared resource interference: i.e. multiple transport slices
      simultaneously share the same resource, and one of them consume
      the resource in surplus.  If the SLO guarantees are strictly
      required, then the network controller can be informed of this by
      requesting a hard guarantee. Note that the terms hard and soft
      limit are requirement oriented and different from what is
	  specified in, <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn"/>). </t>

     <t>
	   Resource failure or fault occurs, such as a link or node failure.
       Where it is important to defend against these, the relevant
       characteristics on resource redundancy (and perhaps some
       other characteristics on restoration speed and other factors) need to be specified.
	     <list style="symbols">
		  <t> Restoration isolation: the network is not impacted for a period
			  longer than the given time. For example,
			  failover or the service restoration takes no longer than
			  some number of seconds. This is specified by Availability  SLO.</t>
		  <t> Protection isolation: the network path is protected with specified backup path.
		    This is specified by Availability  SLO. </t>
          </list>
          </t>
      </list>
	  </t>
		  <t> SLA vs SLO discussion: In defining transport slices, the term  SLO instead of SLA is used even though SLAs are more 
          commonly used term by the operators. SLOs are definitive and measurable parameters associated with a service, therefore, 
          network resource and connectivity requirements are defined accurately. In contrast, service level agreements represent contracts 
          for a service between a service provider and a service consumer (or subscriber). Providers then translate SLA into SLO; 
          these translations vary from one service provider to the other. Therefore, all through within the scope of transport slices term SLO 
          will be used. 
          </t>
</section>
<section title="level of confidence">
	<t> Additionally, transport slices should be able to specify 'level of confidence'. It the ability to satisfy a "guarantee" of an objective. The confidence level (or level of commitment) may be expressed separately for each of the above objectives. For example 
packet loss objective can be no more than 10% loss - 99.9999% of the time, while bandwidth can not go below 1% 99.99% of the time.
</t>
<t>Since no guarantee can prevent from hardware failures (such as losing a node),  additional protection against such issues is possible by specifying confidence level characteristics. 
The confidence does not say anything about the specific implementation of how it is are achieved. Different implementations might use different techniques, from avoiding oversubsription to dedicating particular links or their virtual fractions to particular transport slices. <!--For further discussion, see Appendix A.--> </t>
