    <section title="Introduction">
	<!-- SH-28Jan:  modified the following text for  emphasizing  beneficial features of network slicing. -->
    	<t>
		A number of use cases benefit from establishing network connectivity providing transport and assurance of a specific set of 
        network resources. In this document, as detailed in the subsequent sections, we refer to this connectivity and resource commitment 
        as the transport slice. Services that might benefit from the transport slices include but not limited to:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>5G services (e.g. eMBB, URLLC, mMTC)(See <xref target="TS.23.501-3GPP"/>)</t>
          <t>Network wholesale services</t>
          <t>Network infrastructure sharing among operators</t>
          <t>NFV connectivity and Data Center Interconnect</t>
        </list>
       </t>
	   <t>
		  This document defines the concept of transport slices that provide connectivity with a specific commitment of network resources 
          between a number of end points over a shared network infrastructure. 
        </t>

	<section title="Rationale">
     <t> 
     Transport slices are created and managed within the scope of one or more underlying network technologies (e.g., IP, MPLS, optical). 
     Transport slices are expected to enable a diverse set of applications that have different requirements to coexist on the same network infrastructure. 
     </t>

		<t>
 Transport slice is described as a construct that specifies
   connectivity requirements, emphasizing on assurance of those
   requirements.  Transport slice is unaware of the underlying
   infrastructure connectivity (hence, the term "transport").  The types
   of underlying networking technologies can be based on any combination
   of IP, Ethernet, MPLS, and optical technologies.  
Transport slices
   also include specification of resources related to network functions
   required by customer applications.  
    </t>
     <t> 
        <!-- Jeff's comment June16 (coherency/grammar) the para below doesn't read well, please rephrase it. 
        Are we tryig to say that VPN's are primarily focused on segmentaion while slices on assurance (+ segmentation)? Please do let me know and I will rewrite it accoridingly -->
        Traditionally, VPNs have focussed on segmentation, i.e., creation and management of the private networks. They are bound to a specific traffic type and are technology specific. In contrast, transport slices concern with the assurance of resources required from the network  and provide a common user interface for describing those resources. A service provider can use many aspects of the VPNs to build the transport slices. 
     </t>

    <t>
	Transport slices relate to a more general topic of network slicing. It is not the goal of this document to define this broader concept, 
    but in general, it is to identify the methodology to describe the logical (or abstract) partitioning of network resources associated with a service or 
    an application.

 <section title="Definition and Scope of Transport Slice">

 <t>
 The definition of a transport slice is as follows:

 <!--Jeff's review June16: we already have bunch of definitons in the above section, should we move them here? -->
</t>
<t>
 "A transport slice is a logical network topology connecting a number of endpoints with a set of shared or dedicated network resources,
 that are used to satisfy specific Service Level Objectives (SLOs)".
</t>

<t> The text below describes transport slices in more details.
</t>
<t>
<!--Jeff's review June16: we are rephrasing defintions already made above -->
   <!-- kiran: A transport slice consists of a set of connections between multiple
   endpoints with a specified connectivity type and one or more SLOs associated with it.
SLOs are used to describe different characteristics of network resources associated with the service delivered and corresponding parameters necessary to 
realize the transport slice.-->
      </t>
 <t>
	Transport slice specification is technology-agnostic, and the means for transport slice realization can be chosen depending on 
    several factors such as: service requirements, specifications or capabilities of underlying infrastructure. The structure and different 
    characteristics of transport slices are described in the following  sections.
 </t>
<t>
   The term "transport" in transport slice is derived from the definition of Transport Network in the section 1.3.1 of <xref target="RFC5921"/> : 
   A Transport Network provides transparent transmission of user traffic between attached client devices by establishing and maintaining 
   point-to-point or point-to-multipoint connections between such devices. "Slice" refers to a set of characteristics that separate one type of 
   user-traffic from other types. 
   Transport slice assumes that an underlying transport network is capable of changing 
   the configurations of the network devices on demand, through in-band signaling or via controller(s) and to provide transport transmissions with fulfilling all or some of 
   SLOs to all of the traffic in the slice or to specific flows.
       </t>
  
      </section>

    <section anchor="TS-Char" title="Transport Slice System Characteristics">

      <t>
			The following subsections describe the characteristics needed for support of transport slices.
		</t>

        <section title="Service Level Objectives for Transport Slices">
        <t>
			A transport slice is defined in terms of several quantifiable characteristics or service level objectives (SLOs). These objectives define a set of
			network resource parameters or values necessary to provide a service as requested for a given transport slice. SLOs do not describe
			'how' the transport slices will be implemented or realized in the underlying network layers.  Instead, they are defined in terms of dimensions of operations (time, capacity, etc.), availability and other attributes.
      A transport slice can have one or more SLOs associated with it, all SLO's combined to form an SLA. 
      The SLO values are defined unidirectionally and for specific subsets of two or more endpoints (i.e. for a subset of connections in transport slice).
    </t>
    <t>      
      The SLOs and values associated with them that are exposed to the end user, are in the form of Service Level Indicators (SLIs). If for example the range of latencies a network can provide is 50ms-100ms, then this would be the range of values the end user should be able to request, ti would be as low as 50ms or as high as 100ms or anything in between.
      The values of requested SLOs should always be in the range of values supported. The underlying networks must provide means to monitor and measure the performance of transport 
    slices against the SLOs requested and verify that they are being met. Some SLOs can be measured directly through a collection of metrics and statistics from the network (commonly known as 'telemetry'), while others are deduced from measurable objectives and may require additional tools or mechanisms to measure their target values. 
    </t>

    <section anchor="minSLO" title="Minimal Set of SLOs">
    <t>
      This document defines a minimal set of SLOs and later systems or standards could extend this set and define more SLOs. For example, we included Guaranteed bandwidth which is the minimum requested bandwidth for the transport slice. The later standard might define other SLOs related to bandwidth if needed.
    </t>
<!-- WRT SLIs take a look at: https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/service-level-objectives/#indicators-o8seIAcZ - it has become the industry standard-->
    <t>
      Accordingly, SLOs can be categorized in to 'Directly Measurable Objectives' or 'Indirectly Measurable Objectives' as follows:
    </t>    

    <t>      
      Some of the 'Directly Measurable Objectives' are:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Guaranteed Minimum Bandwidth</t>
        <t>Guaranteed Maximum Latency</t>
        <t>Maximum permissible delay variation</t>    
		    <t>Maximum permissible packet loss rate</t>
        <t>Availability</t>
        <t>Other objectives could be specified</t>
      </list>

      Some of the 'Indirectly Measurable Objectives' are: 
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Security</t>
        <t>others objectives such as geographical restrictions, maximum occupancy level, etc. could be specified</t>
      </list>

      The definition of these objectives are as follows:

      <list style="symbols">

        <t>Guaranteed Minimum Bandwidth: Minimum guaranteed bandwidth between two endpoints at any time. The bandwidth is measured in data rate 
        units of bits per second and is measured unidirectionally.</t>

        <t>Guaranteed Maximum Latency: Upper bound of network latency when transmitting between two endpoints. The latency is 
        measured  in terms of network characteristics (excluding application-level latency). <xref target="RFC2681" /> and <xref target="RFC7679" /> 
        discuss round trip times and one-way metrics, respectively.</t>

        <t>Maximum permissible delay variation: Packet delay variation (PDV) as defined by <xref target="RFC3393"/>, is measured by 
        the difference in the one-way delay between sequential packets in a flow. Minimizing variations in the delay is important for real-time 
        applications.</t>

        <t>Maximum permissible packet loss rate: is defined by
          the ratio of packets dropped to packets transmitted between two endpoints. See <xref target="RFC7680" /></t>

        <t> Availability: is defined as the ratio of uptime to total_time(uptime+downtime), where uptime is the time the transport slice is available
         in accordance with the SLOs associated with it.</t>


	<t>Security: This objective may request for encryption <xref target="RFC4303"/> between two end-points explicitly to meet architecture recommendations as in <xref target="TS33.210"/> or for compliance with <xref target="HIPAA"/> <xref target="PCI"/>. Other security requests may be made as specified in [draft-ietf-i2nsf-capability].
      <list>
	<t> Note: Security violations are not directly observable and cannot be measured as quantifiable metrics. Still, the user of the transport slice should be able to request certain criteria for compliance and identify exceptions and unexpected traffic. For this purpose [i2nsf-nsf-monitoring-data-model] can be leveraged. </t> 
    </list>
</t>
    </list>

      </t>
      
</section> 
 <section anchor="otherSLO" title="Other Objectives">
      <t> 
      Additional objectives, such as certain geographical restrictions or well defined domains that a slice may transit may be necessary. 
    </t>
      <t> 
  <!--Jeff's review - these characteristics are not requested by a client but provided by a client for cases when transport slice is "traffic aware", same goes for "occupancy" EVPN would care about number of MAC addresses while optical transport would not, let's phrase this para differently --> <!--  kiran: added traffice aware-->
      Optionally, when the customer is traffic aware, other traffic specific characteristics may be provided. These include for example,  MTU, traffic-type (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet or
      unstructured), or a higher-level behavior to process traffic according to user-application (which may be realized using network functions). </t>
<t> Maximal occupancy for a transport slice should be provided. Since it carries traffic for multiple flows between the two endpoints, the objectives should also say if they are for 
      the entire connection, group of flows or on per flow basis. Maximal occupancy should specify the scale of the 
      flows (i.e. maximum number of accommodatable flows) and optionally a maximum number of countable resource  units, e.g IP or MAC addresses a slice might consume.
      </t>
		  
<t>
 With these objectives incorporated, a customer sees transport slice as a  dedicated network for its exclusive use. Achieving this may require different types of isolation techniques in provider networks as described in 
 <xref target="ApdxIsolation" />.
</t>
      <t> Additional description of slice attributes is covered in a broader context of 'Generic Network Slice Template' in <xref target="I-D.contreras-teas-slice-nbi"/>. </t>

</section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="tse" title="Transport Slice Endpoints">
      <t>The transport slice endpoints are the conceptual entities that perform any required conversion, or adaptation, and forwarding of the user traffic. The characteristics of the transport slice endpoints (TSE) are:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t> They are conceptual points of connection of a network function, device or application to the transport slice</t>
          <t> They are identified in a request provided by the customer of transport slice (i.e.  higher level operation systems) during the creation of the transport slice</t>
          <t> They are associated with a device,  application and/or network function nodes. A non-exhaustive list of such nodes are routers, switches, firewalls, WAN, 4G/5G RAN nodes, 4G/5G Core nodes, application acceleration, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), server load balancers, NAT44 [RFC3022], NAT64 [RFC6146], HTTP header enrichment functions, and TCP optimizers</t>
          <t> A TSE is identified by its associated node (its IP address, name , ID, etc.), a unique identifier and/or a unique name and other data. A non-exhaustive list of other data includes IP address (v4 or v6), VLAN, port, connectivity type (P2P, P2MP, MP2MP). TBD for more</t>
        </list>
       </t>
       
       <t> Note that the TSE is different from access points (AP) defined in [RFC8453] as an AP is a logical identifier to identify the shared link between the customer and the operator where as TSE is an identifier of an endpoint. Also TSE is different from TE Link Termination Point (LTP) defined in  <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te-topo"/> as it is a conceptual point of connection of a TE node to one of the TE links on a TE node.</t>
       <t> The TSE is similar to the Termination Point (TP) defined in [RFC8345] and can contain more attributes. TSE could be modeled by augmenting the TP model.</t>
<!--
       <t>Note that TSE concept is similar to the Link Termination Point (LTP) defined in  <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te-topo"/> and access points (AP) defined in [RFC8453] with an important difference. The main difference between them is that both LTP and AP are about a specific set of implementations based on characterestics of the TE network while TSE is an effort to hide the details of the underlying realizaion. </t>

       <t>AP is a common identifier for the TE link (See section 2.1 RFC8453) and LTP is a conceptual point of connection of a TE node to one of the TE links, terminated by the TE node (see section 3.5  <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te-topo"/>) whereas TSE is the connectino point to the transports slice. Note that it might be that the trasport slice is realized in a non-TE network and TSE might not be assocaiate to TE network. The TE characteristic of the network might be taken into consideration during the realization of a transport slice in a TE network.</t>
-->
       <t>There is another type of the endpoints called "Transport Slice Realization endpoints (TSRE)". These endpoints are allocated and assigned by the network controller during the realization of a transport slice and are technology-specific, i.e. they depend on the network technology used during the transport slice realization. They are identified by a node and some associated data. A non-exhaustive list of nodes containing TSRE are routers, switches, PON nodes, Wireless nodes and Optical devices.</t>

       <t>Note that there will be a mapping between TSE and TSRE on Transport Slice Controller (TSC). When TSC receives a request via its NBI to create a transport slice between multiple TSEs, it will then find the appropriate TSREs and sends the request via its SBI to realize the transport slice. The detail of this mapping should be addressed in transport slice framework draft (<xref target="I-D.nsdt-teas-ns-framework"/>).</t>

       <t> <xref target="fig_tse_tsre"/> shows an example of a transport slice and its realization between multiple TSEs and TSREs.</t>

			Transport slice may follow a hierarchical relationship to provide a vertical structure to it. This is used
			for composing multi-layer slices in which each layer provides an abstraction, as well as an independent
			monitoring, performance, control and management of the resources.
			The vertical transport slice characteristic could be used in 2 forms:
			<list style="symbols">
			  <t> The Transport slice itself where it represents a hierarchy of abstracted transport slices. In this case, the realization
				  will be done just once with a particular technology.  Thus, the lowest transport slice in the hierarchy that
				  can not be decomposed further will be one to one mapping to its instance of the realized transport slice.</t>
			  <t> Each layer (physical, datalink, or IP) has its own set of resources that  can be provided to the upper layer as
				  a transport slice. Thus, transport slice at one layer is used by the layer above. This type of
				  multi-layer vertical transport slice associates resources at different layers. For example, an IP transport slice
				 would utilize one or more optical transport slice.  In this case, the realization
				will be done for  a particular technology at that particular layer. Thus, the lowest transport slice in this type of hierarchy that
				can not be decomposed further will be an instance of realized physical layer transport slice.</t>

      <xref target="fig_Transport-NS"/> illustrates a case where a transport slice provides connectivity between a set of endpoints pairs 
      with specific characteristics for each SLO (e.g. guaranteed minimum bandwidth of x bps and guaranteed delay of less than y ms). The endpoints 
      may be distributed in the underlay networks, and a transport slice can be deployed across multiple network domains. Also, the endpoints 
      on the same transport slice may belong to the same address space.

      <t>
      <!-- Jeff's comments - can't parse it, please rephrase it-->
      Transport slices involve both customer's and provider's views. 
      A customer 'describes' its requirements in terms of connectivity  with specific SLOs.
      Provider networks address those requirements through 'transport slice realization' (its implementation) using provider network specific technologies.


      <!--The "Transport Slices" provides various connections with various SLOs between various endpoints whereas the transport slice realization 
      addresses its implementation using various technologies.
      In short, the transport slice involves both its definition and its realization; the transport slice definiton addresses the set of connectivities 
      with required SLOs whereas the transport slice realization addresses how this transport slice is deployed in the network for certain network 
      technologies. -->

 <section title="Transport slice Realization">
	 <t>
	 Realization of a Transport Slice is a mapping of underlying infrastructure with its definition. It is a technology specific 
     entity that is created and maintained over its southbound interfaces. The Network controller(s) export the connectivity and 
     resource mappings to the TSC. The network controller abstracts the details of underlying resources from the TSC.
 </t> 
 
 <t>
	 The realization can be achieved in the form of either physical or logical connectivity through VPNs, a variety of tunneling 
     technologies such as Segment Routing, SFC, etc. Accordingly, endpoints may be realized as physical or logical service or network functions.
 </t>

 </section>
  </section>
    <section title="Relationship with End-to-End Network Slicing">
      <t>
        An end-to-end (E2E) network slice is a complete logical network that provides a service in its entirety with a specific
        assurance to the customer. A transport slice concerns with those assurance aspects only within the transport networks.
        Consider <xref target="fig_E2E-NS"/>,
        where a network operator has an E2E network slice that traverses multiple technology-specific networks. Each of these networks might use
        any number of technologies, including but not limited to IP, MPLS, Fiber-Optics (e.g. WDM, DWDM), Passive Optical Networking (PON), Microwave, etc.
      </t>
      <t>
       Each of these networks includes multiple (physical or virtual) nodes and may also provide network functions beyond simply carrying of technology-specific
       protocol data units. The types of nodes used in any of these networks may include:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Packet/frame processing nodes (e.g., Routers, Switches)</t>
        <t>Application servers</t>
        <t>Service Functions(e.g., Firewall, Loadbalancer)</t>
        <t>Radio Access Network (RAN) components</t>
        <t>Mobile Core components</t>
        <t>Microwave transceivers</t>
        <t>Optical repeaters</t>
        <t>etc.</t></list>
      </t>
      <t>
    Each network may support different technologies and an E2E network slice is a combination of these networks. As an example:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Network 1 might contain multiple 5G RAN nodes connected to a few Cell Site Gateways (CSG) routers. </t>
        <t>Network 2 might have one or more layer-3 routers and layer-2 switches which may run on top of an optical network.</t>
        <t>Network 3 might have a number of 5G RAN nodes connected to Passive Optical Network (PON) switches.</t>

      When operator-z creates a specific E2E network slice, it may create

      <t>
     An independent E2E logical network (called E2E network slice) is created for a service (e.g. CCTV, autonomous driving, HD map, etc.) with a specific network SLOs,
		e.g. a secure connection with an E2E latency less than 5ms, from End User-x (EU-x) to End User-y (EU-y). EU-x maybe a 5G user equipment such as an infotainment unit in a 
        car, CCTV, or a car for autonomous driving, etc. and
    EU-y in 5G is 5G application server, IMS, etc.
      </t>
      <t>
    In <xref target="fig_E2E-NS"/>,  "E2E NS"  is that logical
    network with requested SLO between EU-x to EU-y and   is
    associated with a customer and a specific service type.
      </t>

	  <!--
      <t>
    As a concrete example, a customer "City of NY" would like to connect all its CCTV cameras for the entire city to one or more locations for viewing or collection. To this end, it requests local carrier - 'operator-z' in NY to create a new E2E network slice with a bandwidth no-less-than 10Mbps from each CCTV coverage area. In this case, a single E2E network slice will be created by the operator-z for the customer "City of NY", service type of CCTV and requested bandwidth connecting all the CCTV camera zones to one or more control-centers for the collection of video data.
      </t>
      <t>
    It may also be possible that more than one customer and/or service types are associated with an E2E network slice.

    For instance, an E2E network slice is associated with not only to service type CCTV
    but another service "Public Safety", i.e. NS ID 10 is used for two services for "City of NY".

    <section anchor="ApdxIsolation" title="On Isolation Requirements In a Transport Slice">
<t>
Transport slices are perceived as if slice was provisioned for the
customer as a dedicated network with specific SLOs. These committed
SLOs for a given customer should be maintained during the lifetime of
the slice, even in the face of potential disruptions.  Such disruptions
include sudden traffic volume changes either from the customer itself
or others, equipment failures in the service provider network, and
various misbehaviors or attacks.
 </t>
 <t>
The service provider needs to ensure that its network can provide
the requested slices with the availability agreed with its
customers. Some of the main technical approaches to
ensuring guarantees are about network planning, managing capacity,
prioritizing, policing or shaping customer traffic, selecting
dedicated resources, and so on.
 </t>
 <t>
One term that has commonly been used in this context is
&quot;isolation&quot; and is also discussed  in the
[I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn].
 </t>

<!--The term &quot;isolation&quot; implies in part traffic separation (a common
feature in VPNs) and in part the selection of dedicated
resources. 
Dedicated resources can help assure that, for instance,
traffic in other slices does not affect a given slice. However, it
should also be noted that this is one particular realization of a
requirement for guarantees, and other mechanisms may also be used,
such as priority mechanisms or policing amount of traffic entering a
link from different sources. -->
 <t>
A transport slice customer may ask for traffic separation, selection of dedicated
resources, or interference avoidance from other 
traffic. The term &quot;isolation&quot; can refer to any or all of them. 

For instance, dedicated resources can help assure that traffic in other slices does not affect a given slice. Similarly, VPN technologies can provide traffic separation, 
and interference avoidance may be provided by mechanisms such as technical approaches mentioned in the previous paragraph (network planning, capacity management, etc).
Moreover, these are some of the  examples of a particular realization of
the requirement for guarantees; other mechanisms may also be used.
