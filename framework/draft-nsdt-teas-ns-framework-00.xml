<t>This memo discusses setting up special-purpose transport connections using
existing IETF technologies. These connections are called transport slices for
the purposes of this memo. The memo discusses the general framework for this
setup, the necessary system components and interfaces, and how abstract
requests can be mapped to more specific technologies. The memo also discusses
related considerations with monitoring and security.</t>

<t>This memo is intended for discussing interfaces and technologies. It is not
intended to be a new set of concrete interfaces or technologies. Rather, it
should be seen as an explanation of how some existing, concrete IETF VPN and
traffic-engineering technologies can be used to create transport slices. Note
that there are is a rather large of these technologies, and new technologies
or capabilities keep being added. This memo is also not intended presume any
particular technology choice.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>This draft provides a framework for discussing transport
slices, as defined in 
<xref target="I-D.nsdt-teas-transport-slice-definition"/> (to
be replaced by draft-rokui-teas-transport-slice-definition).  It is the
intention in this document to use terminology consistent with this and other
definitions provided in that draft.</t>

<t>In particular, this document uses the following terminology defined in the defintions document:
- Transport Slice
- Transport Slice Controller (TSC)
- Transport Network Controller (TNC)
- Nothrbound Interface (NBI)
- Southbound Interface (SBI)</t>

<t>This framework is intended as a structure for discussing interfaces and
technologies. It is not intended to be a new set of concrete interfaces or
technologies. Rather,  the idea is that existing or under-development IETF
technologies (plural) can be used to realize the ideas expressed here.</t>

<t>For example, virtual private networks (VPNs) have served the industry well as
a means of providing different groups of users with logically isolated access
to a common network.  The common or base network that is used to provide the
VPNs is often referred to as an underlay network, and the VPN is often called
an overlay network.  As an example technology, a VPN may in turn serve as an
underlay network for transport slices.</t>

<t>Note: It is conceivable that extensions to these IETF technologies are needed
in order to fully support all the ideas that can be implemented with slices,
but at least in the beginning there is no plan for the creation of new
protocols or interfaces.</t>

<t>Driven largely by needs surfacing from 5G, the concept of network slicing has
gained traction (<xref target="NGMN-NS-Concept"/>, <xref target="TS23501"/>, <xref target="TS28530"/>, and
<xref target="BBF-SD406"/>).  In <xref target="TS23501"/>, Network Slice is defined as “a logical network
that provides specific network capabilities and network characteristics”, and
a Network Slice Instance is defined as “A set of Network Function instances and
the required resources (e.g. compute, storage and networking resources) which
form a deployed Network Slice”.  According to <xref target="TS28530"/>, an end-to-end
network slice consists of three major types of network segments: Radio Access
Network (RAN), Transport Network (TN) and Core Network (CN).  Transport network
provides the required connectivity between different entities in RAN and CN
segments of an end-to-end network slice, with a specific performance commitment.
For each end-to-end network slice, the topology and performance requirement on
transport network can be very different, which requires the transport network
to have the capability of supporting multiple different transport slices.</t>

<t>While network slices are commonly discussed in the context of 5G, it is
important to note that transport slices are a narrower concept, and focus
primarily on particular network connectivity aspects. Other systems, including
5G deployments, may use transport slices as a component to create entire
systems and concatenated constructs that match their needs, including
end-to-end connectivity.</t>

<t>A Transport Slice could span multiple technologies and multiple administrative
domains.  Depending on the consumer’s requirements, a transport slice could be
isolated from other, often concurrent transport slices in terms of data, control
and management planes.</t>

<t>The consumer expresses requirements for a particular transport slice by
specifying what is required rather than how the requirement is to be fulfilled.
That is, the Transport Slice consumer’s view of a transport slice is an
abstract one.</t>

<t>Thus, there is a need to create logical network structures with required
characteristics.  The consumer of such a logical network can require a degree
of isolation and performance that previously might not have been satisfied by
traditional overlay VPNs.  Additionally, the transport slice consumer might
ask for some level of control of their virtual networks, e.g., to customize
the service paths in a network slice.</t>

<t>This document specifies a framework for the use of existing technologies as
components to provide a transport slice service, and might also discuss (or
reference) modified and potential new technologies, as they develop (such as
candidate technologies described in section 5 of
<xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn"/>).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="requirements" title="Requirements">

<t>It is intended that transport slices can be created to meet specific
requirements, typically expressed as bandwidth, latency, latency variation,
and other desired or required characteristics. Creation is initiated by a
management system or other application used to specify network-related
conditions for particular traffic flows.</t>

<t>And it is intended that, once created, these slices can be monitored,
modified, deleted, and otherwise managed.</t>

<t>It is also intended that applications and components will be able to use
these transport slices to move packets between the specified end-points in
accordance with specified characteristics.</t>

<t>As an example of additional requirements that might apply to transport slices,
see <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn"/> (in particular, section 3).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="framework" title="Framework">

<t>A number of transport slice services will typically be provided over a shared
underlying network infrastructure.  Each transport slice consists of both the
overlay connectivity and a specific set of dedicated network resources and/or
functions allocated in a shared underlay network to satisfy the needs of the
transport slice consumer.  In at least some examples of underlying network
technologies, the integration between the overlay and various underlay
resources is needed to ensure the guaranteed performance requested for
different transport slices.</t>

<t>** Align with definitions draft **</t>

<t>The users of transport slices are:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The management system or other application that creates and manages them.</t>
  <t>The applications and components wishing to use these slices.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Transport users are served by the system that can build transport slices, as
follows:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>A controller takes requests from a management system or other application,
which are then communicated via an abstracted northbound interface. This
interface transmits data objects that describe the needed transport slices in
terms of topology and service level objectives (SLO).</t>
  <t>These requests are assumed to be translated by one or more underlying
systems, which establish specific transport slice instances, using specific
implementation techniques (such as IP and MPLS) implemented on top of the underlying
network infrastructure.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Section 3 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn"/> provides an example architecture
that might apply in using the technology described in that document.</t>

<section anchor="management-systems-or-other-applications" title="Management systems or other applications">

<t>The transport slice system is used by a management system or other application.
These systems and applications may also be a part of a higher level function
in the system, e.g., putting together network functions, access equipment,
application specific components, as well as the transport slices.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="expressing-connectivity-intents" title="Expressing connectivity intents">

<t>The Transport Slice Controller (TSC) northbound interface (NBI) can be used to
communicate between transport slice users (or consumers) and the TSC.</t>

<t>A transport slice user may be a network operator who, in turn, provides the
transport slice to another transport slice user or consumer.</t>

<t>Using the NBI, a consumer expresses requirements for a particular slice by
specifying what is required rather than how that is to be achieved.  That is,
the consumer’s view of a slice is an abstract one.  Consumers normally have
limited (or no) visibility into the provider network’s actual topology and
resource availability information.</t>

<t>This should be true even if both the consumer and provider are associated with
a single administrative domain, in order to reduce the potential for adverse
interactions between transport slice consumers and other uses/users of the
transport network infrastructure.</t>

<t>The benefits of this model can include:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Security: because the transport network (or network operator) does not need
to expose network details (topology, capacity, etc.) to transport slice
consumers the transport network components are less exposed to attack;</t>
  <t>Layered Implementation: the transport network comprises network elements that
belong to a different layer network than consumer applications, and network
information (advertisements, protocols, etc.) that a consumer cannot interpret
or respond to (note - a consumer should not use network information not exposed
via the TSC NBI, even if that information is available);</t>
  <t>Scalability: consumers do not need to know any information beyond that which
is exposed via the NBI.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The general issues of abstraction in a TE network is described more fully in
<xref target="RFC7926"/>.</t>

<t>This framework document does not assume any particular layer at which transport
slices operate as a number of layers (including virtual L2, Ethernet or IP
connectivity) could be employed.</t>

<t>Data models and interfaces are of course needed to set up transport slices,
and specific interfaces may have capabilities that allow creation of specific
layers.</t>

<t>Layered virtual connections are comprehensively discussed in IETF documents
and are widely supported.  See, for instance, GMPLS-based networks (<xref target="RFC5212"/>
and <xref target="RFC4397"/>), or ACTN (<xref target="RFC8353"/> and <xref target="RFC8353"/>).  The principles and
mechanisms associated with layered networking are applicable to transport
slices.</t>

<t>There are several IETF-defined mechanisms for expressing the need for a desired
logical network.  The NBI carries data either in a protocol-defined format, or
in a formalism associated with a modeling language.</t>

<t>For instance:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP) <xref target="RFC5440"/> and
GMPLS User-Network Interface (UNI) using RSVP-TE <xref target="RFC4208"/> use a TLV-based
binary encoding to transmit data.</t>
  <t>Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) <xref target="RFC6241"/> and RESTCONF Protocol
<xref target="RFC8040"/> use XML abnd JSON encoding.</t>
  <t>gRPC/GNMI <xref target="I-D.openconfig-rtgwg-gnmi-spec"/> uses a binary encoded
programmable interface;</t>
  <t>SNMP (<xref target="RFC3417"/>, <xref target="RFC3412"/> and <xref target="RFC3414"/> uses binary encoding (ASN.1).</t>
  <t>For data modeling, YANG (<xref target="RFC6020"/> and <xref target="RFC7950"/>) may be used to model
configuration and other data for NETCONF, RESTCONF, and GNMI - among others;
ProtoBufs can be used to model gRPC and GNMI data; Structure of Management
Information (SMI) <xref target="RFC2578"/> may be used to define Management Information
Base (MIB) modules for SNMP, using an adapted subset of OSI’s
Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1, 1988).</t>
</list></t>

<t>While several generic formats and data models for specific purposes exist,
it is expected that transport slice management may require enhancement or
augmentation of existing data models.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="transport-slice-controller-tsc" title="Transport Slice Controller (TSC)">

<t>The transport slice controller takes abstract requests for
transport slices and implements them using a suitable underlying
technology. A transport slice controller is the key building
block for control and management of the transport slice. It
provides the creation/modification/deletion, monitoring and
optimization of transport Slices in a multi-domain, a
multi-technology and multi-vendor environment.</t>

<t>A TSC northbound interface (NBI) is needed for communicating
details of a transport slice, as well as providing information
to a slice requester/consumer about transport slice status
and performance. The details for this NBI are not in scope
for this document.</t>

<t>The controller provides the following functions:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Provides a technology-agnostic NBI for creation/modification/
deletion of the transport slices. The API exposed by this NBI
communicates the endpoints of the transport slice, transport
slice SLO parameters (and possibly monitoring thresholds),
applicable input selection (filtering) and various policies, and
provides a way to monitor the slice.</t>
  <t>Determines an abstract topology connecting the endpoints of
the transport slice that meets criteria specified via the NBI.The
TSC also retains information about the mapping of this abstract
topology to underlying components of the transport slice as
necessary to monitor transport slice status and performance.</t>
  <t>Provides “Mapping Functions” for the realization of transport slices.
In other words, it will use the mapping functions that:  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
map technology-agnostic NBI request to technology-specific SBIs.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
map filtering/selection information as necessary to entities in the
underlay network.</t>
  <t>Via an SBI, the controller collects Telemetry data (e.g. OAM results,
Statistics, States etc.) for all elements in the abstract topology used
to realize the transport slice.</t>
  <t>Using the Telemetry data from the underlying realization of a
transport slice (i.e. services/paths/tunnels), evaluates the
current performance against transport slice SLO parameters and
exposes them to the transport slice consumer via the NBI. The
TSC NBI may also include a capability to provide notification in
case the transport slice performance reaches threshold values
defined by the transport slice consumer.</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="northbound-inteface-nbi" title="Northbound Inteface (NBI)">

<t>The Transport Slice Controller provides a Northbound Interface (NBI)
that allows consumers of network slices to request and monitor
transport slices.  Consumers operate on abstract transport slices,
with details related to their realization hidden.</t>

<t>The NBI complements various IETF services, tunnels, path models by
providing an abstract layer on top of these models.</t>

<t>The NBI is independent of type of network functions or services
that need to be connected, i.e. it is independent of any specific
storage, software, protocol, or platform used to realize physical or
virtual network connectivity or functions in support of transport
slices.</t>

<t>The NBI uses protocol mechanisms and information passed over
passed over those mechanisms to convey desired attributes for
transport slices and their status. The information is expected to be
represented as a well-defined data model, and should include at
least endpoint and connectivity information, SLO specification, and
status information.</t>

<t>To accomplish this, the NBI needs to convey information needed to
support communication across the NBI, in terms of identifying the
transport slices, as well providing the above model information.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="mapping" title="Mapping">

<t>The main task of the transport slice controller is to map abstract transport
slice requirements to concrete technologies and establish the required
connectivity, and ensuring that required resources are allocated to the
transport slice.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="underlying-technology" title="Underlying technology">

<t>There are a number of different technologies that can be used, including
physical connections, MPLS, TSN, Flex-E, etc.</t>

<t>See <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn"/> - section 5 - for instance, for example
underlying technologies.</t>

<t>Also, as outlined in “applicability of ACTN to Transport Slices” below,
ACTN (<xref target="RFC8453"/>) offers a framework that is used elsewhere in IETF
specifications to create virtual network (VN) services similar to Transport
Slices.</t>

<t>A transport slice can be realized in a network, using specific underlying
technology or technologies.  The creation of a new transport slice will be
initiated with following three steps:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Step 1:  A higher level system requests connections with specific
characteristics via NBI.</t>
  <t>Step 2:  This request will be processed by a Transport Slice Controller
which specifies a mapping between northbound request to  any IETF Services,
Tunnels, and paths models.</t>
  <t>Step 3:  A series of requests for creation of services, tunnels and paths
will be sent to the network to realize the trasport slice.</t>
</list></t>

<t>It is very clear that regardless of how transport slice is realized in the
network (i.e. using tunnels of type RSVP or SR), the  definition of transport
slice does not change at all but rather  its realization.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="applicability-of-actn-to-transport-slices" title="Applicability of ACTN to Transport Slices">

<t><xref target="RFC8453"/> defined three controllers as per the framework for Abstraction and
Control of TE Networks (ACTN) to support virtual network (VN) services -
Customer Network Controller (CNC), Multi-Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC) and
Provisioning Network Controller (PNC). A CNC is responsible for communicating
a customer’s virtual network requirements, a MDSC is responsible for
multi-domain coordination, virtualization/abstraction, customer
mapping/translation and virtual service coordination to realize the virtual
network requirement. Its key role is to detach the network/service requirements
from the underlying technology. A PNC oversees the configuration, monitoring
and collection of the network topology. The PNC is a underlay technology
specific controller.</t>

<t>While the ACTN framework is a generic VN framework that is used for various VN
service beyond the transport slice, it is still a suitable based to understand
how the various controllers interact to realize the Transport slice.</t>

<t>A mapping between the Transport Slice definitions and ACTN definitions is as
shown in Figure 1 below.</t>

<t>The TSC NBI conveys the generic transport slice requirements. These may then be
realized using an SBI.</t>

<t>As per <xref target="RFC8453"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-actn-yang"/>, the CNC-MDSC Interface (CMI)
is used to convey the virtual network service requirements along with the
service models and the MDSC-PNC Interface (MPI) is used to realize the service
along network configuration models. <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-te-service-mapping-yang"/>
further describe how the VPN services can be mapped to the underlying TE
resources.</t>

<t>The Transport Network Controller is depicted as a single block, where as in
the ACTN framework this has been decomposed into MDSC and PNC to handle
multiple domains and various underlay technologies.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC8453"/> also describes TE Network Slicing in the context of ACTN as a
collection of resources that is used to establish a logically dedicated virtual
network over one or more TE networks.  In case of TE enabled underlying network,
ACTN VN can be used as a base to realize the transport network slicing by
coordination among multiple peer domains as well as underlay technology
domains.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="considerations" title="Considerations">

<section anchor="monitoring" title="Monitoring">

<t>Transport slice realization needs to be instrumented in order to track how it
is working, and it might be necessary to modify the transport slice as
requirements change. Dynamic reconfiguration might be needed.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">

<t>Transport slices might use underlying virtualized networking.  All types of
virtual networking require special consideration to be given to the separation
of traffic between distinct virtual networks, as well as some degree of
protection from effects of traffic use of underlying network (and other)
resources from other virtual networks sharing those resources.</t>

<t>For example, if a service requires a specific upper bound of latency, then that
service can be degraded by added delay in transmission of service packets
through the activities of another service or application using the same
resources.</t>

<t>Similarly, in a network with virtual functions, noticeably impeding access to
a function used by another transport slice (for instance, compute resources)
can be just as service degrading as delaying physical transmission of associated
packet in the network.</t>

<t>While a transport slice might include encryption and other security features as
part of the service, consumers might be well advised to take responsibility for
their own security needs, possibly by encrypting traffic before hand-off to a
service provider.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="privacy-considerations" title="Privacy Considerations">
<t>Privacy of transport nework slice service consumers must be preserved.  It
should not be possible for one transport slice consumer to discover the presence
of other consumers, nor should sites that are members of one transport slice
be visible outside the context of that transport slice.</t>

<t>In this sense, it is of paramount importance that the system use the privacy
protection mechanism defined for the specific underlying technologies used,
including in particular those mechanisms designed to preclude acquiring
identifying information associated with any transport slice consumer.</t>

<abstract><t>In Traffic-Engineered (TE) systems, it is sometimes desirable to establish an end-to-end TE path with a set of constraints (such as bandwidth) across one or more networks from a source to a destination.  TE information is the data relating to nodes and TE links that is used in the process of selecting a TE path.  TE information is usually only available within a network.  We call such a zone of visibility of TE information a domain.  An example of a domain may be an IGP area or an Autonomous System.</t><t>In order to determine the potential to establish a TE path through a series of connected networks, it is necessary to have available a certain amount of TE information about each network.

This subset of TE information is called TE reachability information.</t><t>This document sets out the problem statement for the exchange of TE information between interconnected TE networks in support of end-to-end TE path establishment and describes the best current practice architecture to meet this problem statement.  For reasons that are explained in this document, this work is limited to simple TE constraints and information that determine TE reachability.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>This document describes open research challenges for network virtualization.  Network virtualization is following a similar path as previously taken by cloud computing.  Specifically, cloud computing popularized migration of computing functions (e.g., applications) and storage from local, dedicated, physical resources to remote virtual functions accessible through the Internet.  In a similar manner, network virtualization is encouraging migration of networking functions from dedicated physical hardware nodes to a virtualized pool of resources.  However, network virtualization can be considered to be a more complex problem than cloud computing as it not only involves virtualization of computing and storage functions but also involves abstraction of the network itself.  This document describes current research and engineering challenges in network virtualization including the guarantee of quality of service, performance improvement, support for multiple domains, network slicing, service composition, device virtualization, privacy and security, separation of control concerns, network function placement, and testing.  In addition, some proposals are made for new activities in the IETF and IRTF that could address some of these challenges.

<abstract><t>This document describes the framework for Enhanced Virtual Private Network (VPN+) service.  The purpose is to support the needs of new applications, particularly applications that are associated with 5G services, by utilizing an approach that is based on existing VPN and TE technologies and adds features that specific services require over and above traditional VPNs.  Typically, VPN+ will be used to form the underpinning of network slicing, but could also be of use in its own right providing enhanced connectivity services between customer sites.  It is envisaged that enhanced VPNs will be delivered using a combination of existing, modified, and new networking technologies. This document provides an overview of relevant technologies and identifies some areas for potential new work.  It is not envisaged that quite large numbers of VPN+ services will be deployed in a network and, in particular, it is not intended that all VPNs supported by a network will use VPN+ related techniques.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>This document describes the gRPC Network Management Interface (gNMI), a network management protocol based on the gRPC framework.  gNMI supports retrieval and manipulation of state from network elements where the data is represented by a tree structure, and addressable by paths.  The gNMI service defines operations for configuration management, operational state retrieval, and bulk data collection via streaming telemetry.  The authoritative gNMI specification is maintained at [GNMI-SPEC].</t></abstract>
