# Framework for Transport Network Slices

This is the working area for an Internet-Draft in preparation by the TEAS WG's network slicing design team.

## Building the Draft

Formatted text and HTML versions of the draft can be built using `make`.

```sh
$ make
```

Before you can do this, you will need to download the latest MD format file, and Makefile.  You may also have to strip out any HTML wrapper text (header/footer) in both of these files.

This requires that you have the necessary software installed. Namely, you will need "make", "kramdown-rfc2629" and "xml2rfc". See
[the instructions](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/master/doc/SETUP.md) for setting these tools up.

Note also that - depending on your OS and development environment - you may have to get (download) other tools to make the above tools work.  Mostly, remember "google is your friend."
